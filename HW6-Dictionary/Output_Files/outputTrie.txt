how

their
eyes
bright
and
eager

many
a

the
shriek
of
the

the

she
knew
she
had
but
to

them
again
and
so
she
sat
on
with
eyes
and
half
believed
herself
filled
the
air
up
with
the
distant
sobs
of
the
lizard’s
slatepencil

the
of
the
around
itonce

shriek
of

and
dishes

off
her
guests

shared
their

meal

the

voice
of
the
could
hear
the
rattle
of
the
teacups
as
the
march
hare
and
his
mouse
his
way
through
the
neighbouring
the
long
grass
rustled
at
her
feet
as
the
white
rabbit
of
her
little
sister’s
listen
the
whole
place
around
her
became
alive
with
the
strange
would
always
get
into
her
eyesand
still
as
she
listened
or
seemed
queer
little
toss
of
her
head
to
keep
back
the
hair
up
into
hersshe
could
hear
the
very
tones
of
her
voice
and
see
hands
were
clasped
upon
her
knee
and
the
bright
eager
eyes
were
first
she
dreamed
of
little
alice
herself
and
once
again
the
this
was
her
wonderful
adventures
till
she
too
began
dreaming
a
fashion
hand
the
sun
and
of
little
alice
and
all
but
her
sister
sat
still
just
as
she
left
her
her
head
on
what
a
wonderful
dream
it
had
alice
got
up
and
ran
off
while
she
ran
as
well
she
dear
but
now
run
in
to
your
tea
it’s
late’
her
sister
kissed
her
and
said
‘it
was
a
curious
of
that
you
have
just
been
about
and
when
she
sister
as
well
as
she
could
remember
them
all
these
strange
‘oh
i’ve
had
such
a
curious
dream’
said
alice
and
she
told
‘wake
up
alice
dear’
said
her
sister
‘why
what
a
long
sleep
that
had
fluttered
down
from
the
trees
upon
her
head
in
the
lap
of
her
sister
who
was
away
some
tried
to
beat
them
off
and
found
herself
lying
on
the
bank
with
her
she
gave
a
little
scream
half
of
fright
and
half
of
anger
at
this
the
whole
pack
rose
up
into
the
air
and
came
down
time
‘you’re
nothing
but
a
pack
of
‘who
cares
for
you’
said
alice
she
had
grown
to
her
full
size
‘off
with
her
head’
the
queen
shouted
at
the
top
of
her
voice
‘i
won’t’
said
‘hold
your
tongue’
said
the
queen
sentence
‘stuff
and
nonsense’
said
alice
‘the
idea
of
having
‘no
no’
said
the
queen
‘sentence
firstverdict
twentieth
time
that
‘let
the
jury
consider
their
verdict’
the
king
said
for
about
‘it’s
a
pun’
the
king
added
in
an
tone
and
everybody
with
a
smile
there
was
a
dead
‘then
the
words
don’t
fit
you’
said
the
king
round
the
it
began
again
using
the
ink
that
was
down
his
face
as
long
slate
with
one
finger
as
he
found
it
made
no
mark
but
he
now
as
she
spoke
the
little
bill
had
left
off
on
‘never’
said
the
queen
an
at
the
had
this
fit”
you
never
had
fits
my
dear
i
think’
he
said
to
on
the
table
‘nothing
can
be
than
that
then
again“before
‘why
there
they
are’
said
the
king
to
the
‘but
it
goes
on
“they
all
from
him
to
you”’
said
did
with
the
tarts
you
course“i
gave
her
one
they
gave
him
two”
why
that
must
be
what
the
verses
to
himself
‘“we
know
it
to
be
true”
that’s
the
jury
‘all
right
so
far’
said
the
king
and
he
went
on
did
not
being
made
of
the
shook
his
head
‘do
i
look
like
it’
he
said
which
i
could
not
swim”
you
can’t
swim
can
you’
he
added
to
with
one
eye
‘i
seem
to
see
some
in
them
all
he
went
on
out
the
verses
on
his
knee
and
at
trouble
you
know
as
we
needn’t
try
to
find
any
and
yet
i
don’t
‘if
there’s
no
in
it’
said
the
king
‘that
saves
a
world
atom
of
in
it’
but
none
of
them
attempted
to
explain
the
the
jury
all
wrote
down
on
their
slates
‘she
doesn’t
believe
there’s
in
him
‘i’ll
give
him
i
don’t
believe
there’s
an
atom
in
the
last
few
minutes
that
she
wasn’t
a
bit
afraid
of
‘if
any
one
of
them
can
explain
it’
said
alice
she
had
grown
so
king
his
hands
‘so
now
let
the
‘that’s
the
most
important
piece
of
we’ve
heard
yet’
said
between
yourself
and
a
secret
kept
from
all
the
for
this
must
don’t
let
him
know
she
liked
them
him
and
ourselves
and
an
obstacle
that
came
before
she
had
this
my
notion
was
that
you
had
as
we
he
trusts
to
you
to
set
them
in
this
if
i
or
she
should
chance
to
though
they
were
mine
they
all
from
him
to
you
gave
us
three
or
i
gave
her
one
they
gave
him
what
would
become
of
if
she
should
push
the
we
know
it
to
be
he
sent
them
word
i
had
not
but
said
i
could
not
she
gave
me
a
good
and
mentioned
me
to
‘they
told
me
you
had
been
to
these
were
the
verses
the
white
rabbit
come
to
the
end
then
‘begin
at
the
beginning’
the
king
said
‘and
go
on
till
your
majesty’
he
the
white
rabbit
put
on
his
‘where
shall
i
begin
‘read
them’
said
the
what
they’re
‘it
proves
nothing
of
the
sort’
said
alice
‘why
you
don’t
even
‘that
proves
his
guilt’
said
the
clever
thing
the
king
had
said
that
there
was
a
general
of
hands
at
this
it
was
the
first
name
like
an
honest
worse
you
must
have
meant
some
or
else
you’d
have
signed
‘if
you
didn’t
sign
it’
said
the
king
‘that
only
makes
the
can’t
prove
i
did
there’s
no
name
signed
at
the
‘please
your
majesty’
said
the
‘i
didn’t
write
it
and
all
brightened
up
‘he
must
have
imitated
somebody
else’s
hand’
said
the
king
the
about
it’
the
jury
all
looked
‘no
they’re
not’
said
the
white
rabbit
‘and
that’s
the
queerest
‘are
they
in
the
prisoner’s
handwriting’
asked
another
of
the
added
‘it
isn’t
a
all
it’s
a
set
of
nothing
written
on
the
outside’
he
the
paper
as
he
spoke
‘it
isn’t
at
all’
said
the
white
rabbit
‘in
fact
‘who
is
it
to’
said
one
of
the
nobody
which
isn’t
usual
you
‘it
must
have
been
that’
said
the
king
‘unless
it
was
written
written
the
‘i
haven’t
opened
it
yet’
said
the
white
rabbit
‘but
it
seems
to
be
‘what’s
in
it’
said
the
rabbit
jumping
up
in
a
great
hurry
‘this
paper
just
been
‘there’s
more
to
come
yet
please
your
majesty’
said
the
verdict’
he
said
to
the
jury
in
a
low
the
king
pale
and
shut
his
notebook
‘consider
‘then
it
ought
to
be
one’
said
‘it’s
the
oldest
rule
in
the
book’
said
the
regular
rule
you
invented
it
just
‘well
i
shan’t
go
at
any
rate’
said
alice
‘besides
that’s
not
‘nearly
two
miles
high’
added
the
‘you
are’
said
the
‘i’m
not
a
mile
high’
said
everybody
looked
at
fortytwo
all
persons
more
than
a
mile
high
to
leave
the
his
notebook
cackled
out
‘silence’
and
read
out
from
his
book
at
this
moment
the
king
who
had
been
for
some
time
‘but
it
doesn’t
a
bit’
she
thought
to
alice
could
see
this
as
she
was
near
enough
to
look
over
their
some
of
the
jury
wrote
it
down
‘important’
and
some
which
word
sounded
‘importantunimportantunimportantimportant’
as
if
he
were
to
himself
in
an
‘unimportant
of
course
i
meant’
the
king
said
and
went
very
respectful
tone
but
and
faces
at
him
as
he
‘unimportant
your
majesty
means
of
course’
he
said
in
just
beginning
to
write
this
down
on
their
slates
when
the
white
‘that’s
very
important’
the
king
said
to
the
jury
they
‘nothing
whatever’
said
‘nothing
whatever’
persisted
the
‘nothing’
said
‘what
do
you
know
about
this
business’
the
king
said
to
anything
but
sit
with
mouth
open
up
into
the
roof
of
accident
all
except
the
lizard
who
seemed
too
much
to
them
they
set
to
work
very
to
write
out
a
history
of
upset
and
their
slates
and
pencils
had
been
found
and
back
as
soon
as
the
jury
had
a
little
recovered
from
the
shock
of
one
way
up
as
the
to
herself
‘i
should
think
it
would
be
quite
as
much
use
in
the
it
out
again
and
put
it
right
‘not
that
it
signifies
much’
she
tail
about
in
a
melancholy
way
being
quite
to
move
she
soon
the
lizard
in
head
downwards
and
the
poor
little
thing
was
alice
looked
at
the
jurybox
and
saw
that
in
her
haste
she
had
great
emphasis
hard
at
alice
as
he
said
all
the
jurymen
are
back
in
their
proper
placesall’
he
‘the
trial
cannot
proceed’
said
the
king
in
a
very
grave
voice
they
would
that
they
must
be
at
once
and
put
back
into
the

the
gryphon
the
whole
thing
and
longed
to
change
the
‘it’s
the
first
position
in

alice
said
but
was
out
with
his
nose
you
‘but
about
his
toes’
the
mock
turtle
persisted
‘how
could
he
turn
‘she
can’t
explain
it’
said
the
gryphon
‘go
on
with

‘i

the
mock
if
anything
would
happen
in
a
natural
way
alice
said
nothing
she
had
sat
down
with
her
face
in
her
‘well
i
never
heard
it
before’
said
the
mock
turtle
‘but
it
‘that’s
different
from
what
i
to
say
when
i
was
a
child’
said
his
voice
a
timid
and
tremulous
but
when
the
tide
rises
and
sharks
are
and
will
talk
in
contemptuous
tones
of
the
when
the
sands
are
all
dry
he
is
gay
as
a
later
editions
continued
as
trims
his
belt
and
his
and
out
his
as
a
duck
with
eyelids
so
he
with
his
“you
have
me
too
brown
i
must

the
voice
of
the

heard
him
very
queer
quadrille
that
she
knew
what
she
was
and
the
words
got
up
and
began
to
repeat
it
but
her
head
was
so
full
of
the
thought
alice
‘i
might
as
well
be
at
school
at
once’
however
‘how
the
creatures
order
one
about
and
make
one

‘stand
up

repeat
“‘tis
the
voice
of
the
sluggard”’
said
over
begin’
he
looked
at
the
gryphon
as
if
he
thought
it
had
some
kind
should
like
to
hear
her
try
and
repeat
something
now
tell
her
‘it
all
came
different’
the
mock
turtle
‘it’s
all
about
as
curious
as
it
can
be’
said
the
and
said
‘that’s
very
words
all
different
and
then
the
mock
turtle
drew
a
long
her
repeating
‘you
are
old
father
william’
to
the
caterpillar
and
on
her
listeners
were
quiet
till
she
got
to
the
part
their
eyes
and
mouths
so
very
wide
but
she
gained
courage
as
she
the
two
creatures
got
so
close
to
her
one
on
each
side
and
saw
the
white
rabbit
she
was
a
little
nervous
about
it
just
at
so
alice
began
them
her
adventures
from
the
time
when
she
‘explanations
take
such
a
dreadful
‘no
no
the
adventures
first’
said
the
gryphon
in
an
impatient
‘explain
all
that’
said
the
mock
because
i
was
a
different
person
alice
a
little
‘but
it’s
no
use
back
to
‘i
could
tell
you
my
adventuresbeginning
from
this
morning’
the
gryphon
added
‘come
let’s
hear
some
of
your
‘i
mean
what
i
say’
the
mock
turtle
replied
in
an
tone
‘don’t
you
mean
“purpose”’
said
told
me
he
was
a
journey
i
should
say
“with
what
‘of
course
not’
said
the
mock
turtle
‘why
if
a
fish
came
to
me
‘wouldn’t
it
really’
said
alice
in
a
tone
of
great
wise
fish
would
go
anywhere
without
a
‘they
were
to
have
him
with
them’
the
mock
turtle
said
don’t
want
you
with
on
the
song
‘i’d
have
said
to
the
porpoise
“keep
back
please
‘if
i’d
been
the
whiting’
said
alice
whose
thoughts
were
still
‘any
shrimp
could
have
told
you
‘soles
and
eels
of
course’
the
gryphon
replied
rather
‘and
what
are
they
made
of’
alice
asked
in
a
tone
of
great
‘are
done
with
a
now
you
‘boots
and
shoes
under
the
sea’
the
gryphon
went
on
in
a
deep
answer
‘they’re
done
with

alice
looked
down
at
them
and
a
little
before
she
gave

them

‘why
what

‘i

alice
was
‘does

she
‘it

the
gryphon
replied
very
‘i

alice
know
why
it’s
called
a
‘i
can

‘do

alice
‘it’s
very
i
never

so
they
got
their

fast
in

they
couldn’t

they
got
thrown
out
to

so
they
had
to
fall

‘the

the
gryphon
‘that
they
would
go

all
that’
he
said

shut
his

they
have
their

they
both
sat
silent
and
looked
at
‘you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
for
asking
such
a
simple
‘really
you
are
very
‘we
called
him
tortoise
because
he
taught
us’
said
the
mock
‘why
did
you
call
him
tortoise
if
he
wasn’t
one’
alice
sea
the
was
an
old
turtlewe
to
call
him
though
still
a
little
now
and
then
‘we
went
to
school
in
‘when
we
were
little’
the
mock
turtle
went
on
at
last
more
not
help
there
must
be
more
to
come
so
she
sat
still
and
‘thank
you
sir
for
your
story’
but
she
heavy
of
the
mock
turtle
alice
was
very
up
exclamation
of
‘hjckrrh’
from
the
gryphon
and
the
these
words
were
followed
a
very
long
broken
only
‘once’
said
the
mock
turtle
at
last
with
a
deep
sigh
‘i
was
a
she
waited
herself
‘i
don’t
see
how
he
can
even
finish
if
he
doesn’t
begin’
so
they
sat
down
and
nobody
spoke
for
some
minutes
alice
thought
down
both
of
you
and
don’t
speak
a
word
till
i’ve
‘i’ll
tell
it
her’
said
the
mock
turtle
in
a
deep
hollow
tone
history
she
‘this
here
young
lady’
said
the
gryphon
‘she
wants
for
to
know
full
of
tears
but
said
so
they
went
up
to
the
mock
turtle
who
looked
at
them
with
large
fancy
that
he
hasn’t
got
no
sorrow
you
know
come
gryphon
answered
very
in
the
same
words
as
before
‘it’s
all
pitied
him
‘what
is
his
sorrow’
she
asked
the
gryphon
and
nearer
alice
could
hear
him
as
if
his
heart
would
break
sad
and
on
a
little
ledge
of
rock
and
as
they
they
had
not
gone
far
before
they
saw
the
mock
turtle
in
the
it
‘i
never
was
so
about
in
all
my
life
‘everybody
says
“come
on”
here’
thought
alice
as
she
went
executes
nobody
you
know
come
‘why
she’
said
the
gryphon
‘it’s
all
her
fancy
that
they
‘what
is
the
fun’
said
half
to
itself
half
to
she
was
out
of
sight
then
it
chuckled
‘what
fun’
said
the
the
gryphon
sat
up
and
eyes
then
it
the
queen
that
savage
queen
so
she
the
whole
she
thought
it
would
be
quite
as
safe
to
stay
with
it
as
to
the
gryphon
alice
did
not
quite
like
the
look
of
the
creature
but
executions
i
have
ordered’
and
she
walked
off
alice
alone
turtle
and
to
hear
his
history
i
must
go
back
and
see
thing’
said
the
queen
‘and
take
this
young
lady
to
see
the
if
you
don’t
know
what
a
gryphon
is
look
at
the
picture
‘up
they
very
soon
came
upon
a
gryphon
lying
fast
asleep
in
the
of
executions
the
queen
had
thing’
she
said
to
herself
for
she
had
felt
quite
at
to
the
company
‘you
are
all
pardoned’
‘come
that’s
a
as
they
walked
off
together
alice
heard
the
king
say
in
a
low
‘come
on
then’
said
the
queen
‘and
he
shall
tell
you
his
‘i
never
saw
one
or
heard
of
one’
said
‘it’s
the
thing
mock
turtle
soup
is
made
from’
said
the
‘no’
said
alice
‘i
don’t
even
know
what
a
mock
turtle
you
seen
the
mock
turtle
then
the
queen
left
off
quite
out
of
breath
and
said
to
alice
under
sentence
of
players
except
the
king
the
queen
and
alice
were
in
custody
the
end
of
half
an
hour
or
so
there
were
no
left
and
all
who
of
course
had
to
leave
off
being
to
do
this
so
that
head’
those
whom
she
sentenced
were
taken
into
custody
the
the
other
players
and
‘off
with
his
head’
or
‘off
with
all
the
time
they
were
playing
the
queen
never
left
off
quarrelling
cost
them
their
back
to
the
game
the
queen
remarking
that
a
moment’s
delay
in
the
shade
however
the
moment
they
saw
her
they
the
other
guests
had
taken
advantage
of
the
queen’s
absence
and
too
much
to
say
a
word
but
followed
her
back
to
‘let’s
go
on
with
the
game’
the
queen
said
to
alice
and
alice
the
duchess
took
her
choice
and
was
gone
in
a
about
half
no
time
take
your
ground
as
she
spoke
‘either
you
or
your
head
must
be
off
and
that
‘now
i
give
you
fair
warning’
shouted
the
queen
on
‘a
fine
day
your
majesty’
the
duchess
began
in
a
low
weak
in
front
of
them
with
her
like
a
into
began
to
tremble
alice
looked
up
and
there
stood
the
in
the
middle
of
her
favourite
word
‘moral’
and
the
arm
that
was
but
here
to
alice’s
great
surprise
the
duchess’s
voice
died
away
the
‘just
about
as
much
right’
said
the
duchess
‘as
pigs
have
to
fly
feel
a
little
‘i’ve
a
right
to
think’
said
alice
for
she
was
beginning
little
‘thinking
again’
the
duchess
asked
with
another
dig
of
her
birthday
presents
like
that’
but
she
did
not
venture
to
say
it
‘a
cheap
sort
of
present’
thought
alice
‘i’m
glad
they
don’t
of
everything
i’ve
said
as
‘oh
don’t
talk
about
trouble’
said
the
duchess
‘i
make
you
a
‘pray
don’t
trouble
yourself
to
say
it
any
than
that’
a
pleased
‘that’s
nothing
to
what
i
could
say
if
i
chose’
the
duchess
replied
i
had
it
written
down
but
i
can’t
quite
follow
it
as
you
say
‘i
think
i
should
that
better’
alice
said
very
than
what
you
had
been
would
have
appeared
to
them
to
be
appear
to
others
that
what
you
were
or
might
have
been
was
not
simply“never
imagine
yourself
not
to
be
otherwise
than
what
it
is“be
what
you
would
seem
to
be”or
if
you’d
like
it
put
‘i
quite
agree
with
you’
said
the
duchess
‘and
the
moral
of
‘it’s
a
vegetable
it
doesn’t
look
like
one
but
it
‘oh
i
know’
exclaimed
alice
who
had
not
attended
to
this
last
the
moral
of
that
is“the
more
there
is
of
mine
the
less
there
is
everything
that
alice
said
‘there’s
a
large
mustardmine
near
here
‘of
course
it
is’
said
the
duchess
who
seemed
ready
to
agree
‘it’s
a
mineral
i
think’
said
putting
‘right
as
usual’
said
the
duchess
‘what
a
clear
way
you
have
‘only
mustard
isn’t
a
bird’
alice
the
moral
of
that
is“birds
of
a
feather
flock
‘very
true’
said
the
duchess
‘flamingoes
and
mustard
both
bite
have
the
experiment
‘he
might
bite’
alice
replied
not
at
all
anxious
the
temper
of
your
flamingo
shall
i
try
the
the
duchess
said
a
pause
‘the
reason
is
that
i’m
doubtful
‘i
dare
say
you’re
why
i
don’t
put
my
arm
round
your
‘how
fond
she
is
of
in
things’
alice
thought
to
of
that
is“take
care
of
the
sense
and
the
sounds
will
take
care
sharp
little
chin
into
alice’s
shoulder
as
she
added
‘and
the
‘ah
well
it
means
much
the
same
thing’
said
the
duchess
digging
their
own
‘somebody
said’
alice
‘that
it’s
done
everybody
‘tis
love
that
makes
the
world
go
‘’tis
so’
said
the
duchess
‘and
the
moral
of
that
is“oh
‘tis
the
conversation
a
‘the
game’s
on
rather
now’
she
said
way
of
bore
it
as
well
as
she
sharp
chin
however
she
did
not
like
to
be
rude
so
right
height
to
rest
her
chin
upon
alice’s
shoulder
and
it
was
duchess
was
very
ugly
and
because
she
was
alice
did
not
much
like
so
close
to
her
first
because
she
you
can
find
it’
and
she
squeezed
herself
up
to
alice’s
side
‘tut
child’
said
the
duchess
‘everything’s
got
a
moral
if
‘perhaps
it
hasn’t
one’
alice
ventured
to
a
tell
you
just
now
what
the
moral
of
that
is
but
i
shall
remember
it
about
something
my
dear
and
that
makes
you
forget
to
talk
i
startled
when
she
heard
her
voice
close
to
her
ear
‘you’re
she
had
quite
forgotten
the
duchess
this
time
and
was
a
stingy
about
it
you
sweettempered
i
only
wish
people
knew
that
then
they
wouldn’t
be
them
bitterandand
barleysugar
and
such
things
that
make
rule
‘and
vinegar
that
makes
them
sourand
that
she
went
on
very
much
pleased
at
having
found
out
a
new
kind
well
withoutmaybe
it’s
always
that
makes
people
though
‘i
won’t
have
any
in
my
kitchen
at
all
soup
‘when
i’m
a
duchess’
she
said
to
herself
not
in
a
very
hopeful
savage
when
they
met
in
the
to
herself
that
perhaps
it
was
only
the
that
had
made
her
alice
was
very
glad
to
find
her
in
such
a
pleasant
temper
and
they
walked
off
said
the
duchess
as
she
tucked
her
arm
into
alice’s
‘you
can’t
think
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
again

dear
old
chapter
ix
the
mock
turtle’s
for
it
while
the
rest
of
the
party
went
back
to
the
disappeared
so
the
king
and
the
ran
up
and
the
time
he
had
come
back
with
the
duchess
it
had
the
cat’s
head
began
away
the
moment
he
was
gone
and
the
went
off
like
an
‘she’s
in
prison’
the
queen
said
to
the
‘fetch
her
you’d
ask
her
about
alice
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
say
but
‘it
belongs
to
the
remark
that
had
made
the
whole
party
look
so
grave
and
than
no
time
she’d
have
everybody
all
round
it
was
this
the
queen’s
argument
was
that
if
something
wasn’t
done
about
it
in
beheaded
and
that
you
weren’t
to
talk
the
king’s
argument
was
that
anything
that
had
a
head
could
thing
before
and
he
wasn’t
to
begin
at
his
time
of
there
was
a
body
to
cut
it
off
from
that
he
had
never
had
to
do
such
the
executioner’s
argument
was
that
you
couldn’t
cut
off
a
head
what
they
all
spoke
at
once
she
found
it
very
hard
indeed
to
make
out
the
question
and
they
their
arguments
to
her
though
as
the
moment
alice
appeared
she
was
appealed
to
all
three
to
while
all
the
rest
were
quite
silent
and
looked
very
the
the
king
and
the
queen
who
were
all
at
large
crowd
round
it
there
was
a
dispute
on
when
she
got
back
to
the
cheshire
cat
she
was
surprised
to
find
quite
escape
again
and
went
back
for
a
little
more
conversation
with
of
the
ground’
so
she
tucked
it
away
under
her
arm
that
it
might
much’
thought
alice
‘as
all
the
are
gone
from
this
was
over
and
both
the
hedgehogs
were
out
of
sight
‘but
it
the
time
she
had
caught
the
flamingo
and
brought
it
back
the
sort
of
way
to
fly
up
into
a
other
side
of
the
garden
where
alice
could
see
it
in
a
other
the
only
difficulty
was
that
her
flamingo
was
gone
across
to
to
alice
an
excellent
for
croqueting
one
of
them
with
the
hedgehog
was
in
a
fight
with
another
hedgehog
which
whether
it
was
her
turn
or
not
so
she
went
in
search
of
her
of
things
at
all
as
the
game
was
in
such
confusion
that
she
never
for
having
missed
their
and
she
did
not
like
the
passion
she
had
already
heard
her
sentence
three
of
the
players
to
on
as
she
heard
the
queen’s
voice
in
the
alice
thought
she
might
as
well
go
back
and
see
how
the
game
was
‘i’ll
fetch
the
myself’
said
the
king
and
‘off
with
his
head’
she
said
without
even
the
queen
had
only
one
way
of
all
difficulties
great
or
have
this
cat
the
queen
who
was
at
the
moment
‘my
dear
i
wish
you
‘well
it
must
be
removed’
said
the
king
very
and
he
but
i
don’t
remember
‘a
cat
may
look
at
a
king’
said
alice
‘i’ve
read
that
in
some
he
got
behind
alice
as
he
‘don’t
be
impertinent’
said
the
king
‘and
don’t
look
at
me
like
‘i’d
rather
not’
the
cat
kiss
my
hand
if
it
‘i
don’t
like
the
look
of
it
at
all’
said
the
king
‘however
it
introduce
‘it’s
a
friend
of
minea
cheshire
cat’
said
alice
‘allow
me
at
the
cat’s
head
with
great
‘who
are
you
to’
said
the
king
up
to
alice
and
the
queen
smiled
and
passed
‘likely
to
win
that
it’s
worth
while
the
that
the
queen
was
close
behind
her
so
she
went
‘not
at
all’
said
alice
‘she’s
so
extremely’
just
then
she
‘how
do
you
like
the
queen’
said
the
cat
in
a
low
it
ran
away
when
it
saw
mine
groundand
i
should
have
croqueted
the
queen’s
hedgehog
just
now
arch
i’ve
got
to
go
through
next
about
at
the
other
end
of
confusing
it
is
all
the
things
being
alive
for
instance
there’s
at
least
if
there
are
nobody
attends
to
themand
you’ve
no
idea
oneself
speakand
they
don’t
seem
to
have
any
rules
in
complaining
tone
‘and
they
all
quarrel
so
one
can’t
‘i
don’t
think
they
play
at
all
fairly’
alice
began
in
rather
enough
of
it
now
in
sight
and
no
more
of
it
she
had
someone
to
listen
to
her
the
cat
seemed
to
think
that
there
down
her
flamingo
and
began
an
account
of
the
game
very
of
them’
in
another
minute
the
whole
head
appeared
and
then
alice
to
it’
she
thought
‘till
ears
have
come
or
at
least
alice
waited
till
the
eyes
appeared
and
then
nodded
‘it’s
no
enough
for
it
to
speak
‘how
are
you
on’
said
the
cat
as
soon
as
there
was
‘it’s
the
cheshire
cat
now
i
shall
have
somebody
to
talk
a
minute
or
two
she
made
it
out
to
be
a
grin
and
she
said
to
in
the
air
it
her
very
much
at
first
but
could
get
away
without
being
seen
when
she
noticed
a
curious
she
was
about
for
some
way
of
escape
and
whether
left
fond
of
beheading
people
here
the
great
wonder
is
that
there’s
any
‘and
then’
thought
she
‘what
would
become
of
me
they’re
dispute
with
the
queen
but
she
knew
that
it
might
happen
any
alice
began
to
feel
very
to
be
sure
she
had
not
as
yet
had
‘off
with
his
head’
or
‘off
with
her
head’
about
once
in
time
the
queen
was
in
a
furious
passion
and
went
about
all
the
while
and
for
the
hedgehogs
and
in
a
very
the
players
all
played
at
once
without
for
conclusion
that
it
was
a
very
difficult
game
and
off
to
other
parts
of
the
ground
alice
soon
came
to
hedgehog
to
and
as
the
doubledup
soldiers
were
always
a
ridge
or
furrow
in
the
way
wherever
she
wanted
to
send
itself
and
was
in
the
act
of
away
all
this
there
again
it
was
very
to
find
that
the
hedgehog
had
and
when
she
had
got
head
down
and
was
to
with
such
a
expression
that
she
could
not
help
bursting
blow
with
head
it
would
twist
itself
round
and
look
up
in
her
neck
straightened
out
and
was
to
give
the
hedgehog
her
arm
with
legs
down
but
just
as
she
had
she
succeeded
in
body
tucked
away
enough
the
chief
difficulty
alice
found
at
first
was
in
managing
her
up
and
to
stand
on
their
hands
and
feet
to
make
the
the
mallets
live
flamingoes
and
the
soldiers
had
to
double
her
life
it
was
all
ridges
and
furrows
the
balls
were
live
began
alice
thought
she
had
never
seen
such
a
curious
croquetground
other
however
they
got
down
in
a
minute
or
two
and
the
people
began
about
in
all
directions
up
against
‘get
to
your
places’
shouted
the
queen
in
a
voice
of
thunder
queen
tone
‘the
queen
will
hear
you
you
see
she
came
rather
late
and
scream
of
laughter
‘oh
hush’
the
rabbit
in
a
‘she
boxed
the
queen’s
ears’
the
rabbit
began
alice
gave
a
“what
‘no
i
didn’t’
said
alice
‘i
don’t
think
it’s
at
all
a
pity
i
‘did
you
say
“what
a
pity”’
the
rabbit
‘what
for’
said
sentence
of
tiptoe
put
his
mouth
close
to
her
ear
and
‘she’s
over
his
shoulder
as
he
spoke
and
then
himself
‘hush
hush’
said
the
rabbit
in
a
low
tone
he
‘very’
said
alice
‘where’s
the
the
white
rabbit
who
was
peeping
into
her
‘it’sit’s
a
very
fine
day’
said
a
timid
voice
at
her
side
she
very
much
what
would
happen
‘come
on
then’
roared
the
queen
and
alice
joined
the
‘yes’
shouted
meant
for
the
soldiers
were
silent
and
looked
at
alice
as
the
question
‘that’s
right’
shouted
the
queen
‘can
you
play
in
‘their
heads
are
gone
if
it
please
your
majesty’
the
soldiers
‘are
their
heads
off’
shouted
the
minute
or
two
for
them
and
then
marched
off
flowerpot
that
stood
near
the
three
soldiers
wandered
about
for
‘you
shan’t
be
beheaded’
said
alice
and
she
put
them
into
a
to
alice
for
soldiers
remaining
behind
to
execute
the
gardeners
who
‘off
with
their
heads’
and
the
procession
moved
on
three
of
‘i
see’
said
the
queen
who
had
meanwhile
been
the
down
on
one
knee
as
he
spoke
‘we
were
‘may
it
please
your
majesty’
said
two
in
a
very
humble
tone
to
the
rosetree
she
went
on
‘what
have
you
been
‘leave
off
that’
screamed
the
queen
‘you
make
me
giddy’
and
the
royal
children
and
everybody
gardeners
jumped
up
and
began
to
the
king
the
‘get
up’
said
the
queen
in
a
shrill
loud
voice
and
the
the
did
so
very
with
one
the
queen
away
from
him
and
said
to
the
‘turn
dear
she
is
only
a
the
king
laid
his
hand
upon
her
arm
and
said
‘consider
‘nonsense’
said
alice
very
and
and
the
queen
moment
like
a
wild
beast
screamed
‘off
with
her
head
the
queen
crimson
with
fury
and
at
her
for
business
of
‘how
should
i
know’
said
alice
surprised
at
her
own
courage
‘it’s
courtiers
or
three
of
her
own
pack
she
could
not
tell
whether
they
were
gardeners
or
soldiers
faces
and
the
pattern
on
their
backs
was
the
same
as
the
rest
of
were
lying
round
the
rosetree
for
you
see
as
they
were
lying
on
‘and
who
are
these’
said
the
queen
to
the
three
gardeners
all
i
needn’t
be
afraid
of
but
she
added
to
herself
‘why
they’re
only
a
pack
of
cards
‘my
name
is
alice
so
please
your
majesty’
said
alice
very
alice
she
went
on
‘what’s
your
name
‘idiot’
said
the
queen
her
head
and
of
who
only
and
smiled
in
at
her
and
the
queen
said
‘who
is
this’
she
said
it
to
when
the
procession
came
opposite
to
alice
they
all
and
and
faces
so
that
they
couldn’t
see
it’
so
she
stood
still
where
she
a
procession’
thought
she
‘if
people
had
all
to
lie
down
upon
of
such
a
rule
at
processions
‘and
what
would
be
the
use
like
the
three
gardeners
but
she
could
not
remember
having
alice
was
rather
doubtful
whether
she
ought
not
to
lie
down
on
her
procession
came
the
king
and
queen
of
crown
on
a
crimson
velvet
cushion
and
last
of
all
this
noticing
her
then
followed
the
of
the
nervous
at
everything
that
was
said
and
went
them
alice
recognised
the
white
rabbit
it
was
in
a
with
next
came
the
guests
kings
and
queens
and
jumping
along
hand
in
hand
in
couples
they
were
all
the
royal
children
there
were
ten
of
them
and
the
little
dears
diamonds
and
walked
two
and
two
as
the
soldiers
did
these
corners
next
the
ten
courtiers
these
were
ornamented
all
over
the
three
gardeners
oblong
and
flat
with
their
hands
and
feet
at
first
came
ten
soldiers
clubs
these
were
all
and
alice
looked
round
eager
to
see
the
themselves
flat
upon
their
faces
there
was
a
sound
of
many
out
‘the
queen
the
queen’
and
the
three
gardeners
moment
five
who
had
been
across
the
garden
so
you
see
miss
we’re
our
best
she
to’
at
was
to
find
it
out
we
should
all
have
our
heads
cut
off
you
red
rosetree
and
we
put
a
white
one
in
and
if
the
voice
‘why
the
fact
is
you
see
miss
this
here
ought
to
have
been
five
and
seven
said
nothing
but
looked
at
two
two
began
in
a
those
‘would
you
tell
me’
said
alice
a
little
‘why
you
are
all
of
them
them
and
he
himself
the
others
looked
round
also
things’
when
his
eye
chanced
to
fall
upon
alice
as
she
stood
seven
flung
down
his
brush
and
had
just
begun
‘well
of
all
the
bringing
the
cook
tuliproots
instead
of
‘yes
it
is
his
business’
said
five
‘and
i’ll
tell
himit
was
‘that’s
none
of
your
business
two’
said
‘what
for’
said
the
one
who
had
spoken
yesterday
you
to
be
‘you’d
not
talk’
said
five
‘i
heard
the
queen
say
blame
on
on
which
seven
looked
up
and
said
‘that’s
right
five
always
lay
‘i
couldn’t
help
it’
said
five
in
a
sulky
tone
‘seven
jogged
them
say
‘look
out
now
five
don’t
go
paint
over
me
nearer
to
watch
them
and
just
as
she
came
up
to
them
she
heard
one
them
red
alice
thought
this
a
very
curious
thing
and
she
on
it
were
white
but
there
were
three
gardeners
at
it
a
large
rosetree
stood
near
the
of
the
garden
the
chapter
viii
the
queen’s
last
in
the
beautiful
garden
among
the
bright
flowerbeds
and
the
then
she
walked
down
the
little
passage
and
thenshe
found
herself
had
kept
a
piece
of
it
in
her
pocket
till
she
was
about
a
foot
led
into
the
garden
then
she
went
to
work
nibbling
at
the
mushroom
and
began
the
little
golden
key
and
the
door
glass
table
‘now
i’ll
manage
this
time’
she
said
to
once
more
she
found
herself
in
the
long
hall
and
close
to
the
she
everything’s
curious
today
i
think
i
may
as
well
go
in
at
once’
and
right
into
it
‘that’s
very
curious’
she
thought
just
as
she
said
this
she
noticed
that
one
of
the
trees
had
a
my
way
through
the
wood
‘it’s
the
stupidest
teaparty
i
was
at
in
‘at
any
rate
i’ll
never
go
there
again’
said
alice
as
she
the
the
last
time
she
saw
them
they
were
to
put
the
looked
back
once
or
twice
half
hoping
that
they
would
call
neither
of
the
others
took
the
least
notice
of
her
though
great
and
walked
off
the
fell
asleep
this
piece
of
was
more
than
alice
could
bear
she
got
up
‘then
you
shouldn’t
talk’
said
the
‘really
now
you
ask
me’
said
alice
very
much
‘i
of
a
things
are
“much
of
a
muchness”did
you
see
such
a
thing
as

and
the
moon
and
memory
and
muchnessyou
know
you
a
little
shriek
and
went
on
‘that
begins
with
an
m
such
a
doze
but
on
being
the
it
woke
up
again
the
had
eyes
this
time
and
was
off
alice

‘why

the
march
‘why

said
thingseverything
that
begins
with
an

for
it
was
very
sleepy
‘and
they
drew
all
‘they
were
to

the
went
on
and
some
time
without
this
answer
so
poor
alice
that
she
let
the
go
on
‘of
course
they
were’
said
the
‘well

this

‘but
they
were

‘you

‘so
i
‘but
i
don’t
where
did
they
draw
the
alice
did
not
wish
to
offend
the
again
so
she
began
before
as
the
march
hare
had
just
upset
the
milkjug
into
his
advantage
from
the
change
and
alice
was
a
good
deal
worse
off
the
place
of
the
march
hare
the
was
the
only
one
who
got
moved
into
the
dormouse’s
place
and
alice
rather
he
moved
on
as
he
spoke
and
the
followed
him
the
march
‘i
want
a
clean
cup’
the
‘let’s
all
move
one
‘treacle’
said
the
without
at
all
this
‘what
did
they
draw’
said
alice
quite
forgetting
her
you
go
on
‘and
so
these
three
little
sistersthey
were
to
‘one
indeed’
said
the
however
he
consented
dare
say
there
may
be
‘no
please
go
on’
alice
said
very
‘i
won’t
interrupt
again
remarked
‘if
you
can’t
be
civil
you’d
finish
the
story
and
the
march
hare
went
‘sh
sh’
and
the
‘there’s
no
such
thing’
alice
was
beginning
very
but
said
‘it
was
a
the
again
took
a
minute
or
two
to
think
about
it
and
her
question
‘why
did
they
live
at
the
bottom
of
a
to
some
tea
and
breadandbutter
and
then
to
the
alice
did
not
quite
know
what
to
say
to
this
so
she
helped
‘who’s
personal
remarks
now’
the
asked
‘nobody
asked
your
opinion’
said
more
than
‘you
mean
you
can’t
take
less’
said
the
‘it’s
very
easy
to
take
‘i’ve
had
nothing
yet’
alice
replied
in
an
tone
‘so
i
‘take
some
more
tea’
the
march
hare
said
to
alice
very
why
did
they
live
at
the
bottom
of
a
would
be
like
but
it
her
too
much
so
she
went
on
alice
tried
to
fancy
to
herself
what
such
an
extraordinary
‘so
they
were’
said
the
‘very
have
been
‘they
couldn’t
have
done
that
you
know’
alice
remarked
‘they
on
treacle’
said
the
a
minute
questions
of
and
‘what
did
they
live
on’
said
alice
who
always
took
a
great
interest
they
at
the
bottom
of
a
in
a
great
hurry
‘and
their
names
were
elsie
lacie
and
tillie
‘once
upon
a
time
there
were
three
little
sisters’
the
before
it’s
‘and
be
quick
about
it’
added
the
‘or
you’ll
be
asleep
‘yes
please
do’
pleaded
‘tell
us
a
story’
said
the
march
hoarse
feeble
voice
‘i
heard
every
word

fellows
were

opened
his
eyes
‘i
wasn’t
asleep’
he
said
in
they
it
on
both
at
‘then
the
shall’
they
both
cried
‘wake
up
dormouse’
‘i’m
afraid
i
don’t
know
one’
said
alice
rather
at
‘i’m
of
this
i
vote
the
young
lady
tells
us
a
‘suppose
we
change

the

to
‘but
what
happens
when
you
come
to
the
beginning
again’
alice
‘exactly
so’
said
the
‘as
the
things
get
‘then
you
keep
round
i
suppose’
said
and
we’ve
no
time
to
wash
the
things
between
‘yes
that’s
it’
said
the
with
a
sigh
‘it’s
always
teathings
are
put
out
here’
she
a
bright
idea
came
into
alice’s
head
‘is
that
the
reason
so
do
a
thing
i
ask
it’s

o’clock

went
on
in
a
mournful

‘he
‘how
savage’

up

bawled
out
“he’s
the

‘well

the
‘when

went
on
so
long
that
they
had
to

the
shook
itself
and
began
in
sleep
twinkle

a
teatray
in

“up

‘in

i

itself

round
goes
the
clock
in
a
halfpast

only
have
to

you

it
were
nine
o’clock
now

you

‘ah

the
‘he

‘perhaps
not’

‘but
i

‘than

‘i

you
might

something

the
the

for
such
a
long

very
‘but
that’s

with
for
some

with
great
curiosity
and
this
was
his
first
‘your
hair
wants
cutting’

the
he
had
been
at
many
more
than
‘i
didn’t

it

your

alice
‘it’s
laid
for
a

round
the

there
was
nothing
on
it

‘have
some
wine’
the

in
an
down
in
a
large
armchair
at
one
end
of
the
‘there’s
plenty
of
room’

alice
and
she
one
of
it
‘no
room
no
room’
they
cried
out
when
they
saw
the
table
was
a
large
one
but
the
three
were
all
together
suppose
it
doesn’t
for
the
dormouse’
thought
alice
‘only
as
it’s
asleep
cushion
their
elbows
on
it
and
over
head
between
them
fast
asleep
and
the
other
two
were
using
it
as
march
hare
and
the
were
having
tea
at
it
a
was
there
was
a
table
set
out
under
a
tree
in
front
of
the
house
and
chapter
vii
a
mad
wish
i’d
gone
to
see
the
to
herself
‘suppose
it
should
be
mad
all
i
about
two
feet
high
even
then
she
walked
up
it
rather
nibbled
some
more
of
the
lefthand
bit
of
mushroom
and
herself
was
so
large
a
house
that
she
did
not
like
to
go
nearer
till
she
chimneys
were
like
ears
and
the
roof
was
thatched
with
fur
of
the
march
hare
she
thought
it
must
be
the
right
house
because
she
had
not
gone
much
farther
before
she
came
in
sight
of
the
without
a
cat
it’s
the
most
curious
thing
i
saw
in
my
‘well
i’ve
often
seen
a
cat
without
a
grin’
thought
alice
‘but
a
remained
some
time
the
rest
of
it
had
beginning
with
the
end
of
the
tail
and
with
the
grin
‘all
right’

the
cat
and
this
time
it
vanished
quite
so
you
make
one
quite
‘i
said
pig’
replied
alice
‘and
i
wish
you
wouldn’t
keep
appearing
‘did
you
say
pig
or
fig’

the
again
on
a
branch
of
a
it
was
in
march’
as
she
said
this
she
looked
up
and
there
was
the
perhaps
as
this
is
may
it
won’t
be
madat
least
not
so
mad
said
to
herself
‘the
march
hare
will
be
much
the
most
which
the
march
hare
was
said
to
live
‘i’ve
seen
hatters
before’
appear
and
a
minute
or
two
she
walked
on
in
the
alice
waited
a
little
half
expecting
to
see
it
again
but
it
did
‘i
thought
it
would’
said
the
cat
and
vanished
in
a
natural
‘it
into
a
pig’
alice
said
just
as
if
it
had
come
forgotten
to
‘bythebye
what
became
of
the
baby’
said
the
cat
‘i’d
it
appeared

while
she
was
at
the
place
where
it
had
alice

not
much
surprised
at
this
she
was
so
to
‘you’ll
see
me
there’
said
the
cat
and
‘i
should
like
it
very
much’
said
alice
‘but
i
haven’t
been
queen
‘call
it
what
you
like’
said
the
cat
‘do
you
play
croquet
with
‘i
call
it
not

said
wag
my
tail
when
i’m

therefore
i’m

wags
tail
when
it’s
pleased
now
i
growl
when
i’m
pleased
‘well
then’
the
cat
went
on
‘you
see
a
dog
growls
when
it’s
‘i
suppose
so’
said
‘to
begin
with’
said
the

‘a

at
all
however
she
went
on
‘and
‘you
must
be’
said
the
cat
‘or
you
wouldn’t
have
come
‘how
do
you
know
i’m
mad’
said
you’re
‘oh
you
can’t
help
that’
said
the
cat
‘we’re
all
mad
here
i’m
‘but
i
don’t
want
to
go
among
mad
people’
alice
hare
visit
either
you
like
they’re
both
a
and
in
that
direction’
the
other
paw
‘lives
a
‘in
that
direction’
the
cat
said
right
paw
round
‘what
sort
of
people
live
about
alice
felt
that
this
could
not
be
denied
so
she
tried
another
‘oh
you’re
sure
to
do
that’
said
the
cat
‘if
you
only
walk
‘so
long
as
i
get
somewhere’
alice
added
as
an
‘then
it
doesn’t
which
way
you
go’
said
the
‘i
don’t
much
care
where’
said
‘that
depends
a
good
deal
on
where
you
want
to
get
to’
said
the
tell
me
please
which
way
i
ought
to
go
from
‘come
it’s
pleased
so
far’
thought
alice
and
she
went
on
‘would
whether
it
would
like
the
name
however
it
only
grinned
a
little
‘cheshire
puss’
she
began
rather
as
she
did
not
at
all
felt
that
it
ought
to
be
treated
with
thought
still
it
had
very
long
claws
and
a
great
many
teeth
so
the
cat
only
grinned
when
it
saw
alice
it
looked
goodnatured
tree
a
few
yards
was
a
little
startled
seeing
the
cheshire
cat
on
a
bough
of
to
herself
‘if
one
only
knew
the
right
way
to
change
them’
when
children
she
knew
who
might
do
very
well
as
pigs
and
was
just
rather
a
handsome
pig
i
think’
and
she
began
over
to
herself
‘it
would
have
made
a
ugly
child
but
it
it
trot
away
into
the
wood
‘if
it
had
grown
up’
she
so
she
set
the
little
creature
down
and
felt
quite
to
felt
that
it
would
be
quite
absurd
for
her
to
carry
it
be
no
about
it
it
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
pig
and
that
she
looked
down
into
face
in
some
alarm
this
time
there
this
creature
when
i
get
it
home’
when
it
grunted
again
so
alice
was
just
beginning
to
think
to
herself
‘now
what
am
i
to
do
to
say
which
and
they
went
on
for
some
while
in
now’
the
poor
little
thing
sobbed
again
or
grunted
it
was
said
alice
‘i’ll
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
no
there
were
no
tears
‘if
you’re
to
turn
into
a
pig
my
she
thought
and
looked
into
eyes
again
to
see
if
there
were
like
the
look
of
the
thing
at
all
‘but
perhaps
it
was
only
eyes
were
small
for
a
baby
altogether
alice
did
a
very
nose
much
more
like
a
snout
than
a
real
nose
also
see
what
was
the
with
it
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
it
the
baby
grunted
again
and
alice
looked
very
into
face
‘don’t
grunt’
said
alice
‘that’s
not
at
all
a
proper
way
of
little
thing
grunted
in
it
had
left
off
this
murder
to
leave
it
behind’
she
said
the
last
words
out
loud
and
thought
alice
‘they’re
sure
to
kill
it
in
a
day
or
two
wouldn’t
it
it
out
into
the
open
air
‘if
i
don’t
take
this
child
away
with
ear
and
left
foot
so
as
to
prevent
itself
she
twist
it
up
into
a
sort
of
knot
and
then
keep
tight
hold
of
as
soon
as
she
had
made
out
the
proper
way
of
it
which
was
or
two
it
was
as
much
as
she
could
do
to
hold
straightening
itself
out
again
so
that
altogether
for
the
first
like
a
steamengine
when
she
caught
it
and
kept
itself
up
like
a
starfish’
thought
alice
the
poor
little
thing
was
little
creature
and
held
out
and
legs
in
all
directions
alice
caught
the
baby
with
some
difficulty
as
it
was
a
a
fryingpan
her
as
she
went
out
but
it
just
missed
croquet
with
the
queen’
and
she
out
of
the
room
the
cook
flinging
the
baby
at
her
as
she
spoke
‘i
must
go
and
get
ready
to
‘here
you
may
nurse
it
a
bit
if
you
like’
the
duchess
said
to
‘wow
wow
the
when
he
for
he
can
i
beat
him
when
he
‘i
speak
to
my
that
alice
could
hear
the
the
baby
up
and
down
and
the
poor
little
thing
howled
while
the
duchess
sang
the
second
verse
of
the
song
she
kept
‘wow
wow
in
which
the
cook
and
the
baby
because
he
knows
it
he
only
it
to
and
beat
him
when
he
‘speak
to
your
little
every
lullaby
to
it
as
she
did
so
and
it
a
shake
at
the
end
and
with
that
she
began
her
child
again
a
sort
‘oh
don’t
me’
said
the
duchess
‘i
never
could
abide
it
twelve
be
so
she
went
on
again
‘twentyfour
hours
i
think
or
the
hint
but
the
cook
was
the
soup
and
seemed
not
alice
glanced
rather
at
the
cook
to
see
if
she
meant
to
‘talking
of
axes’
said
the
duchess
‘chop
off
her
twentyfour
hours
to
turn
round
on
what
work
it
would
make
with
the
day
and
night
you
see
the
earth
an
of
off
a
little
of
her
knowledge
‘just
think
‘which
would
not
be
an
advantage’
said
alice
who
felt
very
glad
to
growl
‘the
world
would
go
round
a
deal
than
it
‘if
everybody
their
own
business’
the
duchess
said
in
a
large
saucepan
flew
close
it
and
very
it
an
agony
of
terror
‘oh
there
goes
his
precious
nose’
as
an
‘oh
please
mind
what
you’re
doing’
cried
alice
jumping
up
and
down
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
say
whether
the
blows
hurt
it
or
them
even
when
they
hit
her
and
the
baby
was
so
much
of
saucepans
plates
and
dishes
the
duchess
took
no
notice
the
duchess
and
the
babythe
fireirons
came
first
then
followed
fire
and
at
once
set
to
work
everything
within
her
reach
was
to
fix
on
one
the
cook
took
the
cauldron
of
soup
off
be
as
well
to
introduce
some
other
subject
of
conversation
while
alice
did
not
at
all
like
the
tone
of
this
remark
and
thought
it
‘you
don’t
know
much’
said
the
duchess
‘and
that’s
a
pleased
to
have
got
into
a
‘i
don’t
know
of
any
that
do’
alice
said
very
‘they
all
can’
said
the
duchess
‘and
most
of
‘em
that
cats
could
‘i
didn’t
know
that
cheshire
cats
always
grinned
in
fact
i
didn’t
and
not
to
her
so
she
took
courage
and
went
on
jumped
but
she
saw
in
another
moment
that
it
was
addressed
to
the
she
said
the
last
word
with
such
sudden
that
alice
‘it’s
a
cheshire
cat’
said
the
duchess
‘and
that’s
why
your
cat
grins
like
not
quite
sure
whether
it
was
good
for
her
to
speak
first
‘please
would
you
tell
me’
said
alice
a
little
for
she
the
hearth
and
from
ear
to
that
did
not
sneeze
were
the
cook
and
a
large
cat
which
was
without
a
moment’s
pause
the
only
things
in
the
sneezed
and
as
for
the
baby
it
was
and
there
was
too
much
of
it
in
the
air
even
the
as
well
as
she
could
for
‘there’s
too
much
in
that
soup’
alice
said
to
a
large
cauldron
which
seemed
to
be
full
of
the
middle
a
baby
the
cook
was
over
the
fire
one
end
to
the
other
the
duchess
was
on
a
threelegged
stool
the
door
led
right
into
a
large
kitchen
which
was
full
of
smoke
idiotic’
and
she
opened
the
door
and
went
‘oh
there’s
no
use
in
to
him’
said
alice
‘anything
you
like’
said
the
footman
and
began
‘but
what
am
i
to
do’
said
and
remark
with
variations
‘i
shall
sit
here’
he
said
‘on
and
off
the
footman
seemed
to
think
this
a
good
for
repeating
it’s
enough
to
drive
one
dreadful’
she
muttered
to
herself
‘the
way
all
the
creatures
it
was
no
doubt
only
alice
did
not
like
to
be
told
so
‘it’s
question
you
‘are
you
to
get
in
at
all’
said
the
footman
‘that’s
the
‘how
am
i
to
get
in’
asked
alice
again
in
a
louder
as
if
nothing
had
‘or
next
day
maybe’
the
footman
continued
in
the
same
tone
and
broke
to
pieces
against
one
of
the
trees
behind
out
straight
at
the
footman’s
head
it
just
grazed
his
at
this
moment
the
door
of
the
house
opened
and
a
large
plate
‘i
shall
sit
here’
the
footman
remarked
‘till
but
at
any
rate
he
might
answer
questionshow
am
i
to
get
in’
said
to
herself
‘his
eyes
are
so
very
at
the
top
of
his
alice
thought
‘but
perhaps
he
can’t
help
it’
he
was
up
into
the
sky
all
the
time
he
was
and
if
you
were
inside
you
might
knock
and
i
could
let
you
out
you
without
attending
to
her
‘if
we
had
the
door
between
us
for
‘there
might
be
some
sense
in
your
knocking’
the
footman
went
‘please
then’
said
alice
‘how
am
i
to
get
a
great
crash
as
if
a
dish
or
kettle
had
been
broken
to
on
withina
constant
and
and
every
now
and
hear
you’
and
there
was
a
most
extraordinary
are
because
they’re
such
a
noise
inside
no
one
two
reasons
first
because
i’m
on
the
same
side
of
the
door
as
‘there’s
no
sort
of
use
in
knocking’
said
the
footman
‘and
that
alice
went
up
to
the
door
and
door
up
into
the
fishfootman
was
gone
and
the
other
was
on
the
ground
near
wood
for
fear
of
their
her
and
when
she
next
peeped
out
alice
laughed
so
much
at
this
that
she
had
to
run
back
into
then
they
both
low
and
their
curls
got
invitation
for
the
duchess
to
play
only
changing
the
order
of
the
words
a
little
‘from
the
queen
to
play
croquet’
the
frogfootman
in
the
same
solemn
in
a
solemn
tone
‘for
the
duchess
an
invitation
from
the
as
large
as
himself

this
he
over
to
the
the
fishfootman
began
producing
from
under
his
arm
a
great
and
crept
a
little
way
out
of
the
wood
to
over
their
heads
she
felt
very
curious
to
know
what
it
was
all
frog
and
both
footmen
alice
noticed
had
hair
that
another
footman
in
livery
with
a
round
face
and
large
eyes
like
fishand
rapped
at
the
door
with
his
knuckles
it
was
otherwise
judging
his
face
only
she
would
have
called
him
woodshe
him
to
be
a
footman
because
he
was
in
to
do
next
when
a
footman
in
livery
came
out
of
for
a
minute
or
two
she
stood
at
the
house
and
chapter
vi
pig
and
had
brought
herself
down
to
nine
inches
righthand
bit
again
and
did
not
venture
to
go
near
the
house
till
i
should
frighten
them
out
of
their
wits’
so
she
began
nibbling
at
there’
thought
alice
‘it’ll
never
do
to
come
upon
them
this
size
place
with
a
little
house
in
it
about
four
feet
high
‘whoever
to
be
done
i
wonder’
as
she
said
this
she
came
upon
an
size
the
next
thing
is
to
get
into
that
beautiful
gardenhow
is
to
be
from
one
minute
to
another
however
i’ve
got
back
to
my
now
how
all
these
changes
are
i’m
never
sure
what
i’m
and
began
to
herself
as
usual
‘come
there’s
half
my
plan
felt
quite
strange
at
first
but
she
got
to
it
in
a
few
it
was
so
long
since
she
had
been
anything
near
the
right
size
that
succeeded
in
bringing
herself
down
to
her
usual
other
and
and
until
she
she
set
to
work
very
nibbling
first
at
one
and
then
at
remembered
that
she
still
held
the
pieces
of
mushroom
in
her
hands
every
now
and
then
she
had
to
stop
and
it
a
while
she
could
for
her
neck
kept
among
the
branches
down
again
into
nest
alice
down
among
the
trees
as
well
‘well
be
off
then’
said
the
pigeon
in
a
sulky
tone
as
it
like
them
for
eggs
as
it
happens
and
if
i
was
i
shouldn’t
want
i
‘it
matters
a
good
deal
to
me’
said
alice
‘but
i’m
not
whether
you’re
a
little
girl
or
a
for
eggs
i
know
that
well
enough
and
what
it
to
minute
or
two
which
gave
the
pigeon
the
of
adding
this
was
such
a
new
idea
to
alice
that
she
was
quite
silent
for
a
kind
of
serpent
that’s
all
i
can
‘i
don’t
believe
it’
said
the
pigeon
‘but
if
they
do
why
then
child
‘but
little
girls
eat
eggs
quite
as
much
as
serpents
do
‘i
have
eggs
certainly’
said
alice
who
was
a
very
denying
it
i
suppose
you’ll
be
me
next
that
you
never
with
such
a
neck
as
that
no
no
you’re
a
serpent
and
there’s
no
contempt
‘i’ve
seen
a
good
many
little
girls
in
my
time
but
never
‘a
story
indeed’
said
the
pigeon
in
a
tone
of
the
the
of
changes
she
had
gone
through
that
‘ii’m
a
little
girl’
said
alice
rather
as
she
invent
‘well
what
are
you’
said
the
pigeon
‘i
can
see
you’re
‘but
i’m
not
a
serpent
i
tell
you’
said
alice
‘i’m
ai’m
the
sky
ugh
should
be
free
of
them
at
last
they
must
come
wriggling
down
pigeon
voice
to
a
shriek
‘and
just
as
i
was
‘and
just
as
i’d
taken
the
highest
tree
in
the
wood’
continued
see
‘i’m
very
sorry
you’ve
been
annoyed’
said
alice
who
was
beginning
haven’t
had
a
wink
of
sleep
these
three
‘but
i
must
be
on
the
lookout
for
serpents
night
and
day
why
‘as
if
it
wasn’t
trouble
enough
the
eggs’
said
the
anything
more
till
the
pigeon
had
alice
was
more
and
more
but
she
thought
there
was
no
use
serpents
there’s
no
hedges’
the
pigeon
went
on
without
attending
to
her
‘but
‘i’ve
tried
the
roots
of
trees
and
i’ve
tried
banks
and
i’ve
‘i
haven’t
the
least
idea
what
you’re
about’
said
to
suit
and
added
with
a
kind
of
sob
‘i’ve
tried
every
way
and
nothing
‘serpent
i
say
again’
the
pigeon
but
in
a
more
‘i’m
not
a
serpent’
said
alice
‘let
me
‘serpent’
screamed
the
was
her
with
her
draw
back
in
a
hurry
a
large
pigeon
had
flown
into
her
face
of
the
trees
under
which
she
had
been
when
a
sharp
hiss
to
dive
in
among
the
which
she
found
to
be
nothing
but
the
just
succeeded
in
curving
it
down
into
a
graceful
zigzag
and
was
neck
would
bend
about
in
any
like
a
serpent
she
tried
to
get
her
head
down
to
them
and
was
to
find
that
as
there
seemed
to
be
no
chance
of
her
hands
up
to
her
head
except
a
little
among
the
distant
green
she
was
them
about
as
she
spoke
but
no
result
seemed
to
shoulders
got
to
and
oh
my
poor
hands
how
is
it
i
can’t
see
‘what
can
all
that
green
stuff
be’
said
alice
‘and
where
have
sea
of
green
that
lay
far
below
an
immense
length
of
neck
which
seemed
to
rise
like
a
stalk
out
of
were
nowhere
to
be
found
all
she
could
see
when
she
looked
down
changed
into
alarm
in
another
moment
when
she
found
that
her
‘come
my
head’s
free
at
last’
said
alice
in
a
tone
of
delight
lefthand
mouth
but
she
did
it
at
last
and
managed
to
swallow
a
morsel
of
so
against
her
foot
that
there
was
room
to
open
set
to
work
at
once
to
eat
some
of
the
other
bit
her
chin
was
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
as
she
was
so
she
was
a
good
deal
this
very
sudden
change
but
she
blow
her
chin
it
had
struck
her
the
righthand
bit
to
try
the
effect
the
next
moment
she
felt
a
‘and
now
which
is
which’
she
said
to
herself
and
nibbled
a
little
of
the
edge
with
each
stretched
her
round
it
as
far
as
they
would
go
and
broke
off
a
round
she
found
this
a
very
difficult
question
however
at
last
to
make
out
which
were
the
two
of
it
and
as
it
was
alice
remained
at
the
mushroom
for
a
minute
aloud
and
in
another
moment
it
was
out
of
‘of
the
mushroom’
said
the
caterpillar
just
as
if
she
had
asked
‘one
side
of
what
the
other
side
of
what’
thought
alice
to
grow
‘one
side
will
make
you
grow
and
the
other
side
will
make
mushroom
and
crawled
away
in
the
grass
remarking
as
it
and
yawned
once
or
twice
and
shook
itself
then
it
got
down
off
a
minute
or
two
the
caterpillar
took
the
out
of
this
time
alice
waited
until
it
chose
to
speak
again
into
mouth
and
began
‘you’ll
get
to
it
in
time’
said
the
caterpillar
and
it
put
she
thought
of
herself
‘i
wish
the
creatures
wouldn’t
be
so
‘but
i’m
not
to
it’
pleaded
poor
alice
in
a
piteous
tone
itself
upright
as
it
spoke
it
was
three
inches
‘it
is
a
very
good
height
indeed’
said
the
caterpillar
said
alice
‘three
inches
is
such
a
height
to
‘well
i
should
like
to
be
a
little
larger
sir
if
you
wouldn’t
‘are
you
content
now’
said
the
before
and
she
felt
that
she
was
her
alice
said
nothing
she
had
never
been
so
much
contradicted
in
her
‘i
don’t
know’
said
the
doesn’t
like
changing
so
often
you
‘oh
i’m
not
particular
as
to
size’
alice
replied
‘only
‘what
size
do
you
want
to
be’
it
the
caterpillar
was
the
first
to
there
was
for
some
‘it
is
wrong
from
beginning
to
end’
said
the
caterpillar
have
got
‘not
quite
right
i’m
afraid’
said
alice
‘some
of
the
‘that
is
not
said
right’
said
the
be
off
or
i’ll
kick
you
down
do
you
think
i
can
listen
all
day
to
such
said
his
father
‘don’t
give
yourself
‘i
have
answered
three
questions
and
that
is
what
made
you
so
yet
you
an
eel
on
the
end
of
your
that
your
eye
was
as
steady
as
‘you
are
old’
said
the
youth
‘one
would
lasted
the
rest
of
my
and
the
muscular
strength
which
it
gave
to
my
and
argued
each
case
with
my
‘in
my
youth’
said
his
father
‘i
took
to
the
pray

you

you

the
bones

the

anything
tougher

‘you

the
youth

me

the
‘i

‘in

the

he

grey

a
backsomersault
in

said
the
youth
‘as
i
mentioned
why
i
do
it
again
and
but
now
that
i’m
sure
i
have
‘i

father
william
replied
to
his

you
think
at
your
age
it
is
and
yet
you
stand
on
your
‘and
your
hair
become
very
‘you
are
old

william’
the
young
man
alice
her
hands
and
‘repeat
“you
are
old
father
william”’
said
the
different’
alice
replied
in
a
very
melancholy
‘well
i’ve
tried
to
say
“how
doth
the
little
busy
bee”
but
it
all
‘can’t
remember
what
things’
said
the
usedand
i
don’t
keep
the
same
size
for
ten
minutes
‘i’m
afraid
i
am
sir’
said
alice
‘i
can’t
remember
things
as
you’re
changed
do
took
the
out
of
mouth
again
and
said
‘so
you
minutes
it
puffed
away
without
but
at
last
it
perhaps
all
it
might
tell
her
something
worth
for
alice
thought
she
might
as
well
wait
as
she
had
nothing
else
to
do
‘no’
said
the
‘is
that
all’
said
alice
swallowing
down
her
anger
as
well
as
‘keep
your
temper’
said
the
this
sounded
alice
and
came
back
to
‘come
back’
the
caterpillar
called
her
‘i’ve
something
state
of
mind
she
good
reason
and
as
the
caterpillar
seemed
to
be
in
a
very
here
was
another
question
and
as
alice
could
not
think
of
‘why’
said
the
you
ought
to
tell
me
who
you
are
short
remarks
and
she
drew
herself
up
and
said
very
‘i
alice
felt
a
little
irritated
at
the
caterpillar’s
such
which
brought
them
back
again
to
the
beginning
of
the
‘you’
said
the
caterpillar
‘who
are
is
it
would
feel
very
queer
to
‘well
perhaps
your
feelings
may
be
different’
said
alice
‘all
i
‘not
a
bit’
said
the
queer
won’t
that
into
a
butterfly
i
should
think
you’ll
feel
it
a
have
to
turn
into
a
chrysalisyou
will
some
day
you
knowand
‘well
perhaps
you
haven’t
found
it
so
yet’
said
alice
‘but
when
‘it
isn’t’
said
the
different
in
a
day
is
very
‘for
i
can’t
it
myself
to
begin
with
and
being
so
‘i’m
afraid
i
can’t
put
it
more
clearly’
alice
replied
very
‘i
don’t
see’
said
the
myself
you
‘i
can’t
explain
myself
i’m
afraid
sir’
said
alice
‘because
i’m
‘what
do
you
mean
that’
said
the
caterpillar
changed
several
since
who
i
was
when
i
got
up
this
but
i
think
i
must
have
rather
‘ii
know
sir
just
at
presentat
least
i
this
was
not
an
for
a
conversation
alice
‘who
are
you’
said
the
her
in
a
languid
sleepy
at
last
the
caterpillar
took
the
out
of
mouth
and
the
caterpillar
and
alice
looked
at
each
other
for
some
time
in
chapter
v
advice
from
a
and
not
the
smallest
notice
of
her
or
of
anything
that
was
on
the
top
with
a
mushroom
and
her
eyes
met
those
of
a
large
she
stretched
herself
up
on
tiptoe
and
peeped
over
the
edge
of
was
on
the
top
of
behind
it
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
as
well
look
and
see
herself
and
when
she
had
looked
under
it
and
on
both
of
it
there
was
a
large
mushroom
near
her
about
the
same
height
looked
like
the
right
thing
to
eat
or
drink
under
the
the
flowers
and
the
blades
of
grass
but
she
did
not
see
anything
the
great
question
was
what
alice
looked
all
round
her
question
is
suppose
i
ought
to
eat
or
drink
something
or
other
but
the
i’ve
got
to
grow
up
again
let
me
seehow
is
it
to
be
managed
only
been
the
right
size
to
do
it
oh
dear
i’d
forgotten
‘i
should
have
liked
it
tricks
very
much
ifif
against
a
buttercup
to
rest
herself
and
fanned
herself
with
one
of
‘and
yet
what
a
dear
little
puppy
it
was’
said
alice
as
she
till
the
puppy’s
bark
sounded
quite
faint
in
the
set
off
at
once
and
ran
till
she
was
quite
and
out
of
breath
this
seemed
to
alice
a
good
for
her
escape
so
tongue
out
of
mouth
and
great
eyes
half
all
the
while
till
at
last
it
sat
down
a
good
way
off
little
way
each
time
and
a
long
way
back
and
the
puppy
began
a
series
of
short
charges
at
the
stick
a
moment
to
be
trampled
under
feet
ran
round
the
thistle
again
very
like
having
a
game
of
play
with
a
carthorse
and
expecting
over
heels
in
hurry
to
get
hold
of
it
then
alice
it
other
side
the
puppy
made
another
rush
at
the
stick
and
to
keep
herself
from
being
run
over
and
the
moment
she
appeared
on
and
made
believe
to
worry
it
then
alice
dodged
behind
a
great
all
feet
at
once
with
a
yelp
of
delight
and
at
the
held
it
out
to
the
puppy
whereupon
the
puppy
jumped
into
the
air
what
she
did
she
up
a
little
bit
of
stick
all
her
hungry
in
which
case
it
would
be
very
to
eat
her
up
in
spite
she
was
all
the
time
at
the
thought
that
it
might
said
alice
in
a
tone
and
she
tried
hard
to
whistle
to
it
stretching
out
one
paw
to
touch
her
‘poor
little
an
enormous
puppy
was
down
at
her
with
large
round
eyes
great
the
trees
a
little
sharp
bark
just
over
her
head
made
her
look
up
in
how
to
set
about
it
and
while
she
was
peering
about
arranged
the
only
difficulty
was
that
she
had
not
the
smallest
it
sounded
an
excellent
plan
no
doubt
and
very
and
the
best
thing
is
to
find
my
way
into
that
garden
i
think
that
will
about
in
the
wood
‘is
to
grow
to
my
right
size
again
and
the
‘the
first
thing
i’ve
got
to
do’
said
alice
to
herself
as
she
safe
in
a
thick
appeared
but
she
ran
off
as
hard
as
she
could
and
soon
found
something
out
of
a
bottle
they
all
made
a
rush
at
alice
the
moment
in
the
middle
being
held
up
two
guineapigs
who
were
animals
and
birds
the
poor
little
lizard
bill
the
door
she
ran
out
of
the
house
and
found
quite
a
crowd
of
began
as
soon
as
she
was
small
enough
to
get
so
she
swallowed
one
of
the
cakes
and
was
to
find
that
make
me
smaller
i
some
change
in
my
size
and
as
it
can’t
make
me
larger
it
head
‘if
i
eat
one
of
these
cakes’
she
thought
‘it’s
sure
to
little
cakes
as
they
lay
on
the
floor
and
a
bright
idea
came
into
alice
noticed
with
some
surprise
that
the
pebbles
were
all
which
another
dead
she
said
to
herself
and
shouted
out
‘you’d
not
do
that
window
and
some
of
them
hit
her
in
the
face
‘i’ll
put
a
stop
to
for
the
next
moment
a
of
little
pebbles
came
in
at
‘a
of
what’
thought
alice
but
she
had
not
long
to
alice
heard
the
rabbit
say
‘a
will
do
to
begin
roof
off’
a
minute
or
two
they
began
about
again
wonder
what
they
will
do
next
if
they
had
any
sense
they’d
take
there
was
a
dead
and
alice
thought
to
herself
out
as
loud
as
she
could
‘if
you
do
i’ll
set
dinah
at
‘we
must
burn
the
house
down’
said
the
rabbit’s
voice
and
alice
‘so
you
did
old
fellow’
said
the
like
a
jackinthebox
and
up
i
goes
like
a
a
deal
too
flustered
to
tell
youall
i
know
is
something
at
alice
‘well
i
knowno
more
thank
ye
i’m
nowbut
last
came
a
little
feeble
voice
‘that’s
bill’
us
all
about
nowdon’t
choke
himhow
was
it
old
fellow
what
happened
to
you
and
then
another
confusion
of
voices‘hold
up
his
then
the
rabbit’s
voice
along‘catch
him
you
the
hedge’
the
first
thing
she
heard
was
a
general
chorus
of
‘there
goes
see
what
would
happen
to
herself
‘this
is
bill’
she
gave
one
sharp
kick
and
waited
and
about
in
the
chimney
close
above
her
till
she
heard
a
little
animal
she
couldn’t
guess
of
what
sort
it
she
drew
her
foot
as
far
down
the
chimney
as
she
could
and
i
think
i
can
kick
a
bill’s
place
for
a
good
deal
this
fireplace
is
narrow
to
be
sure
herself
‘shy
they
seem
to
put
everything
upon
bill
i
wouldn’t
be
‘oh
so
bill’s
got
to
come
down

said

all

she
made
out
the
words
‘where’s
the
of
little
cartwheels
and
the
sound
of
a
good
many
she
waited
for
some
time
without
anything
more
at
last
came
sure
i
don’t
want
to
stay
in
here
any
next
as
for
pulling
me
out
of
the
window

only
wish

could
cucumberframes

thought
alice
‘i
wonder
what
they’ll
two
little
shrieks
and
more
sounds
of
broken
glass
‘what
a
hand
again
and
made
another
snatch
in
the
air
this
time
there
all’
‘do
as
i
tell
you
you
coward’
and
at
last
she
spread
out
now
and
then
such
as
‘sure
i
don’t
like
it
honour
at
all
there
was
a
long
this
and
alice
could
only
hear
‘well
it’s
got
no
business
there
at
any
rate
go
and
take
it
‘sure
it
honour
but
it’s
an
arm
for
all
‘an
arm
you
goose
who
saw
one
that
size
why
it
fills
the
‘sure
it’s
an
arm

he
it
‘now
tell
me
pat
what’s
that
in
the
help
me
out
of
this’
sounds
of
more
broken
‘digging
for
apples
indeed’
said
the
rabbit
‘here
come
for
apples
then
a
voice
she
had
never
heard
before
‘sure
then
i’m
here
next
came
an
angry
voicethe
rabbit’s‘pat
pat
where
are
you’
cucumberframe
or
something
of
the
from
which
she
concluded
that
it
was
just
possible
it
had
fallen
into
but
she
heard
a
little
shriek
and
a
fall
and
a
crash
of
broken
hand
and
made
a
snatch
in
the
air
she
did
not
get
hold
of
she
heard
the
rabbit
just
under
the
window
she
spread
out
‘that
you
won’t’
thought
alice
and
till
she
go
round
and
get
in
at
the
that
attempt
a
failure
alice
heard
it
say
to
itself
‘then
the
door
opened
and
alice’s
elbow
was
pressed
hard
against
the
rabbit
came
up
to
the
door
and
tried
to
open
it
but
as
the
rabbit
and
had
no
reason
to
be
afraid
of
house
quite
forgetting
that
she
was
now
about
a
thousand
as
the
rabbit
to
look
for
her
and
she
trembled
till
she
shook
then
came
a
little
pattering
of
feet
on
the
stairs
alice
knew
it
‘mary
ann
mary
ann’
said
the
voice
‘fetch
me
my
gloves
this
a
voice
and
to
quite
a
conversation
of
it
altogether
but
a
few
minutes
she
and
so
she
went
on
first
one
side
and
then
the
other
and
for
any
lessons
in
here
why
there’s
room
for
you
and
no
room
at
‘oh
you
foolish
alice’
she
answered
herself
‘how
can
you
thenalways
to
have
lessons
to
learn
oh
i
shouldn’t
like
now
that’ll
be
a
comfort
one
waynever
to
be
an
old
‘but
then’
thought
alice
‘shall
i
never
get
any
than
i
tone
‘at
least
there’s
no
room
to
grow
up
any
more
grow
up
i’ll
write
onebut
i’m
grown
up
now’
she
added
in
a
there
ought
to
be
a
book
written
about
me
that
there
ought
and
when
kind
of
thing
never
happened
and
now
here
i
am
in
the
middle
of
can
have
happened
to
me
when
i
to
read
fairytales
i
yetit’s
rather
curious
you
know
this
sort
of
life
i
do
wonder
rabbits
i
almost
wish
i
hadn’t
gone
down
that
rabbitholeand
always
larger
and
smaller
and
being
about
mice
‘it
was
much
pleasanter
at
home’
thought
poor
alice
‘when
one
again
no
wonder
she
felt
seemed
to
be
no
sort
of
chance
of
her
out
of
the
and
she
grew
no
larger
still
it
was
very
and
as
for
alice
the
little
magic
bottle
had
now
had
full
can
do
no
more
whatever
happens
what
will
become
of
of
the
window
and
one
foot
up
the
chimney
and
said
to
herself
‘now
still
she
went
on
and
as
a
last
she
put
one
arm
one
elbow
against
the
door
and
the
other
arm
round
her
was
not
even
room
for
this
and
she
tried
the
effect
of
lying
down
and
very
soon
had
to
kneel
down
on
the
floor
in
another
minute
it
was
too
late
to
wish
that
she
went
on
and
drunk
quite
so
grow
any
moreas
it
is
i
can’t
get
out
at
the
doori
do

i
down
the
bottle
to
herself
‘that’s
quite
enoughi
hope
i
and
had
to
stoop
to
save
her
neck
from
being
broken
she
drunk
half
the
bottle
she
found
her
head
against
the
it
did
so
indeed
and
much
than
she
had
expected
before
she
i’m
quite
of
being
such
a
tiny
little
this
bottle
i
do
hope
it’ll
make
me
grow
large
again
for
to
herself
‘whenever
i
eat
or
drink
anything
so
i’ll
just
see
to
her
lips
‘i
know
something
is
sure
to
happen’
she
with
the
words
‘drink
me’
but
nevertheless
she
it
and
put
bottle
that
stood
near
the
lookingglass
there
was
no
label
this
and
was
just
to
leave
the
room
when
her
eye
fell
upon
a
of
tiny
white
kid
gloves
she
took
up
the
fan
and
a
pair
of
the
in
the
window

on
it
as
she
had
a
fan
and
two

three

time
she
had
found
her
way
into
a
tidy
little
room
with
a

ordering
people
about

alice
went
on
‘that
they’d
let
dinah

i’ve
got
to

only
i
here
and
get

for

“coming
in

that
would
happen
‘“miss

‘how

alice

he’ll
be
when
he
finds
out
who
i
am

i’d
take
‘he

me
for

herself

she
ran

to
explain
the
quick
now’
and
alice
was
so
much
that
she
ran
off
at
out
here
run
home
this
moment
and
fetch
me
a
pair
of
gloves

called
out
to
her
in
an
angry
tone

the

since
her

she
very
goodnaturedly
began
about
for
them

they
moment
that
it
was
for
the
fan
and
the
pair
of

where
can
i
have
dropped
them

wonder’
alice
guessed
in
my
fur
and
whiskers
she’ll
get
me
as
sure
as
ferrets
it
to
itself
‘the

the
duchess
oh
my
dear

about
as
it
went

if
it

lost
something

she
it
was

back
again

in

back

finish
his
half

that
the
mouse
had
changed
his
mind

was
a
little
pattering
of
footsteps
in
the
and
she
looked
and
lowspirited
in
a
little

however

and
here
poor
alice
began
to
cry
again
for
she
felt
cat
in
the
world
oh
my
dear
dinah
i
wonder
if
i
shall
see
tone
‘nobody
seems
to
like
her
down
here
and
i’m
sure
she’s
the
‘i
wish
i
hadn’t
mentioned
dinah’
she
said
to
herself
in
a
on
various
pretexts
they
all
moved
off
and
alice
was
soon
left

‘come
away
my
dears
it’s
high
time
you
were
all
in

throat’
and
a
canary
called
out
in
a
voice
remarking
‘i
must
be
home
the
birds
off
at
once
one
old
magpie

itself
up

speech

a
among
the
party
some
of
she’ll
eat
a
little
bird
as
soon
as
look
at
can’t
think
and
oh
i
wish
you
could
see
her
the
birds
‘dinah’s
our
cat
and
she’s
such
a
capital
one
for
mice
alice
replied
for
she
was
always
ready
to
talk
about
her
‘and
who
is
dinah
if
i
might
venture
to
ask
the
question’
said
nobody
in
particular
‘she’d
soon
fetch
it
‘i
wish
i
had
our
dinah
here
i
know
i
do’
said
alice
aloud
‘you’re
enough
to
try
the
of
an
your
temper’
‘hold
your
tongue
ma’
said
the
young
crab
a
daughter
‘ah
my
dear
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
never
to
out
of
sight
and
an
old
crab
took
the
of
to
‘what
a
pity
it
wouldn’t
stay’
sighed
the
as
soon
as
it
was
head
and
walked
a
little
others
all
joined
in
chorus
‘yes
please
do’
but
the
mouse
only
‘please
come
back
and
finish
your
story’
alice
called
it
and
the
mouse
only
growled
in
you
‘i
didn’t
mean
it’
pleaded
poor
alice
‘but
you’re
so
away
‘you
insult
me
such
‘i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort’
said
the
mouse
up
and
about
her
‘oh
do
let
me
help
to
‘a
knot’
said
alice
always
ready
to
make
herself
useful
and
‘i
had
not’
cried
the
mouse
and
very
bend
i
‘i
beg
your
pardon’
said
alice
very
‘you
had
got
to
the
‘you
are
not
attending’
said
the
mouse
to
alice
‘what
are

old

“i’ll

“let

that
‘fury
said
to
something
like
about
it
while
the
mouse
was
so
that
her
idea
of
the
tale
the
mouse’s
tail
‘but
why
do
you
call
it
sad’
and
she
kept
on
‘it
is
a
long
tail
certainly’
said
alice
down
with
wonder
‘mine
is
a
long
and
a
sad
tale’
said
the
mouse
to
alice
would
be
it
is
you
hatec
and
d’
she
added
in
a
whisper
half
afraid
that
‘you
promised
to
tell
me
your
history
you
know’
said
alice
‘and
begged
the
mouse
to
tell
them
something
however
it
was
over
at
last
and
they
sat
down
again
in
a
ring
and
the
small
ones
choked
and
had
to
be
patted
on
the
confusion
as
the
large
birds
complained
that
they
could
not
the
next
thing
was
to
eat
the
comfits
this
caused
some
noise
to
say
she
simply
and
took
the
thimble
as
solemn
as
that
she
did
not
dare
to
laugh
and
as
she
could
not
think
of
alice
thought
the
whole
thing
very
absurd
but
they
all
looked
so
thimble’
and
when
it
had
this
short
speech
they
all
presented
the
thimble
‘we
beg
your
of
this
then
they
all
round
her
once
more
while
the
dodo
‘hand
it
over
here’
said
the
‘only
a
thimble’
said
alice
your
pocket’
he
went
on
to
‘of
course’
the
dodo
replied
very
‘what
else
have
you
got
‘but
she
must
have
a
prize
herself
you
know’
said
the
apiece
all
not
got
into
it
and
them
round
as
prizes
there
was
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
box
of
comfits
the
salt
water
alice
had
no
idea
what
to
do
and
in
despair
she
put
her
hand
in
way
‘prizes
and
the
whole
party
at
once
round
her
out
in
a
‘why
she
of
course’
said
the
dodo
to
alice
with
one
‘but
who
is
to
give
the
prizes’
quite
a
chorus
of
voices
‘everybody
won
and
all
must
have
of
him
while
the
rest
waited
in
at
last
the
dodo
the
position
in
which
you
see
shakespeare
in
the
and
it
sat
for
a
long
time
with
one
finger
pressed
upon
this
question
the
dodo
could
not
answer
without
a
great
deal
of
round
it
and
asking
‘but
who
the
dodo
called
out
‘the
race
is
over’
and
they
all
when
they
had
been
half
an
hour
or
so
and
were
quite
dry
liked
so
that
it
was
not
easy
to
know
when
the
race
was
over
away’
but
they
began
when
they
liked
and
left
off
when
along
the
course
here
and
there
there
was
no
‘one
two
three
shape
doesn’t
matter’
it
said
and
then
all
the
party
were
first
it
out
a
in
a
sort
of
circle
‘the
you
how
the
dodo
managed
you
might
like
to
try
the
thing
yourself
some
winter
day
i
will
‘why’
said
the
dodo
‘the
best
way
to
explain
it
is
to
do
it’
and
and
no
one
else
seemed
inclined
to
say
but
the
dodo
had
paused
as
if
it
thought
that
somebody
ought
to
‘what
is
a
caucusrace’
said
alice
not
that
she
wanted
much
to
the
best
thing
to
get
us
dry
would
be
a
‘what
i
was
to
say’
said
the
dodo
in
an
tone
‘was
tittered
the
bent
down
head
to
hide
a
smile
some
of
the
other
those
long
words
and
what’s
more
i
don’t
believe
you
do
either’
‘speak
english’
said
the
‘i
don’t
know
the
of
that
the
adjourn
for
the
immediate
adoption
of
more
‘in
that
case’
said
the
dodo
to
feet
‘i
dry
me
at
‘as
wet
as
ever’
said
alice
in
a
melancholy
tone
‘it
doesn’t
seem
to
alice
as
it
normans”
how
are
you
on
now
my
dear’
it
continued
crown
william’s
conduct
at
first
was
moderate
but
the
of
it
advisable
to
go
with
edgar
to
meet
william
and
offer
him
the
mouse
did
not
notice
this
question
but
went
on
archbishop
duck
‘it’s
a
frog
or
a
worm
the
question
is
what
did
‘i
know
what
“it”
means
well
enough
when
i
find
a
thing’
said
“it”
‘found
it’
the
mouse
replied
rather
‘of
course
you
know
‘found
what’
said
the
the
patriotic
archbishop
of
canterbury
found
it
the
earls
of
mercia
and
northumbria
for
him
and
even
‘i
thought
you
did’
said
the
mouse
‘i
proceed
“edwin
and
‘not
i’
said
the
you
‘i
beg
your
pardon’
said
the
mouse
but
very
‘ugh’
said
the
with
a
mercia
and
to
usurpation
and
conquest
edwin
and
morcar
the
earls
to
the
english
who
wanted
leaders
and
had
been
of
late
the
conqueror
whose
cause
was
favoured
the
pope
was
soon
is
the
thing
i
know
all
round
if
you
please
‘ahem’
said
the
mouse
with
an
important
air
‘are
you
all
ready
sure
she
would
catch
a
bad
cold
if
she
did
not
get
dry
very
in
the
middle
alice
kept
her
eyes
on
it
for
she
dry
enough’
they
all
sat
down
at
once
in
a
large
ring
with
the
called
out
‘sit
down
all
of
you
and
listen
to
me
i’ll
soon
make
at
last
the
mouse
who
seemed
to
be
a
person
of
among
age
there
was
no
more
to
be
how
old
it
was
and
as
the
refused
to
tell
you
and
must
know
better’
and
this
alice
would
not
allow
who
at
last
sulky
and
would
only
say
‘i
am
known
them
all
her
life
indeed
she
had
quite
a
long
argument
with
to
alice
to
find
herself
familiarly
with
them
as
if
she
consultation
about
this
and
a
few
minutes
it
seemed
quite
the
first
question
of
course
was
how
to
get
dry
again
they
had
to
them
and
all
wet
cross
and
birds
with
draggled
feathers
the
animals
with
their
fur
clinging
they
were
indeed
a
queerlooking
party
that
assembled
on
the
chapter
iii
a
caucusrace
and
a
long
way
and
the
whole
party
swam
to
the
a
and
an
and
several
other
curious
creatures
alice
led
birds
and
animals
that
had
fallen
into
it
there
were
a
duck
and
a
it
was
high
time
to
go
for
the
pool
was
quite
with
history
and
you’ll
why
it
is
i
hate
cats
and
voice
‘let
us
get
to
the
shore
and
then
i’ll
tell
you
face
was
quite
pale
with
passion
alice
thought
and
it
said
in
a
mouse
heard
this
it
round
and
swam
back
to
her
won’t
talk
about
cats
or
either
if
you
don’t
like
them’
when
so
she
called
it
‘mouse
dear
do
come
back
again
and
the
pool
as
it
away
from
her
as
hard
as
it
could
go
and
quite
a
commotion
tone
‘i’m
afraid
i’ve
it
again’
for
the
mouse
was
says
it
kills
all
the
rats
andoh
dear’
cried
alice
in
a
you
know
and
he
says
it’s
so
useful
it’s
worth
a
hundred
pounds
of
thingsi
can’t
remember
half
of
themand
it
belongs
to
a
you
throw
them
and
it’ll
sit
up
and
beg
for
and
all
know
with
oh
such
long
brown
hair
and
it’ll
fetch
things
our
house
i
should
like
to
show
you
a
little
brighteyed
terrier
answer
so
alice
went
on
‘there
is
such
a
nice
little
dog
conversation
‘are
youare
you
fondofof
dogs’
the
mouse
did
‘i
won’t
indeed’
said
alice
in
a
great
hurry
to
change
the
subject
cats
nasty
low
vulgar
things
don’t
let
me
hear
the
name
tail
‘as
if
i
would
talk
on
such
a
subject
our
family
always
‘we
indeed’
cried
the
mouse
who
was
down
to
the
end
of
more
if
you’d
rather
felt
certain
it
must
be
‘we
won’t
talk
about
her
alice
again
for
this
time
the
mouse
was
bristling
all
over
and
such
a
capital
one
for
miceoh
i
beg
your
pardon’
her
faceand
she
is
such
a
nice
soft
thing
to
nurseand
pool
‘and
she
sits
so
the
fire
her
paws
thing’
alice
went
on
half
to
herself
as
she
swam
about
in
take
a
fancy
to
cats
if
you
could
only
see
her
she
is
such
a
dear
about
it
and
yet
i
wish
i
could
show
you
our
cat
dinah
i
think
‘well
perhaps
not’
said
alice
in
a
tone
‘don’t
be
you
like
cats
if
you
were
‘not
like
cats’
cried
the
mouse
in
a
shrill
passionate
voice
the
poor
animal’s
feelings
‘i
quite
forgot
you
didn’t
like
‘oh
i
beg
your
pardon’
cried
alice
afraid
that
she
had
sudden
leap
out
of
the
water
and
seemed
to
quiver
all
over
with
was
the
first
sentence
in
her
french
lessonbook
the
mouse
gave
anything
had
happened
so
she
began
again
‘ou
est
ma
chatte’
her
knowledge
of
history
alice
had
no
very
clear
notion
how
long
a
french
mouse
come
over
with
william
the
conqueror’
for
with
‘perhaps
it
doesn’t
english’
thought
alice
‘i
but
it
said
and
seemed
to
her
to
wink
with
one
of
little
a
mouseto
a
mousea
mouseo
mouse’
the
mouse
looked
at
her
she
remembered
having
seen
in
her
brother’s
latin
grammar
‘a
way
of
to
a
mouse
she
had
never
done
such
a
thing
before
of
about
here
o
mouse’
alice
thought
this
must
be
the
began
‘o
mouse
do
you
know
the
way
out
of
this
pool
i
am
very
it
can
talk
at
any
rate
there’s
no
harm
in
trying’
so
everything
is
so
outoftheway
down
here
that
i
should
think
‘would
it
be
of
any
use
now’
thought
alice
‘to
speak
to
this
in
like
she
was
now
and
she
soon
made
out
that
it
was
only
a
mouse
that
it
must
be
a
walrus
or
hippopotamus
but
then
she
remembered
how
off
and
she
swam
nearer
to
make
out
what
it
was
at
first
she
just
then
she
heard
something
about
in
the
pool
a
little
however
everything
is
queer
being
drowned
in
my
own
tears
that
will
be
a
queer
thing
to
be
to
find
her
way
out
‘i
shall
be
punished
for
it
now
i
suppose
‘i
wish
i
hadn’t
cried
so
much’
said
alice
as
she
swam
about
was
nine
feet
made
out
that
she
was
in
the
pool
of
tears
which
she
had
wept
when
of
houses
and
behind
them
a
railway
however
she
sea
some
children
digging
in
the
sand
with
wooden
spades
then
a
to
on
the
english
coast
you
find
a
of
machines
in
her
life
and
had
come
to
the
general
conclusion
that
wherever
you
railway’
she
said
to
herself
alice
had
been
to
the
seaside
once
had
somehow
fallen
into
the
sea
‘and
in
that
case
i
can
go
back
she
was
up
to
her
chin
in
salt
water
her
first
idea
was
that
as
she
said
these
words
her
foot
and
in
another
moment
and
i
declare
it’s
too
bad
that
it
thought
the
poor
child
‘for
i
never
was
so
small
as
this
before
lying
on
the
glass
table
as
before
‘and
things
are
worse
than
but
the
little
door
was
shut
again
and
the
little
golden
key
now
for
the
garden’
and
she
ran
with
all
speed
back
to
the
little
sudden
change
but
very
glad
to
find
herself
still
in
‘that
was
a
narrow
escape’
said
alice
a
good
deal
at
it
just
in
time
to
avoid
away
out
that
the
cause
of
this
was
the
fan
she
was
and
she
about
two
feet
high
and
was
on
she
soon
herself
it
and
found
that
as
as
she
could
guess
she
was
be
small
again’
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
table
to
she
was
‘how
can
i
have
done
that’
she
thought
‘i
that
she
had
put
on
one
of
the
rabbit’s
little
white
kid
gloves
as
she
said
this
she
looked
down
at
her
hands
and
was
surprised
to
of
being
all
alone
of
tears
‘i
do
wish
they
would
put
their
heads
down
i
am
so
very
till
i’m
somebody
else”but
oh
dear’
cried
alice
with
a
sudden
if
i
like
being
that
person
i’ll
come
up
if
not
i’ll
stay
down
shall
only
look
up
and
say
“who
am
i
then
tell
me
that
first
and
use
their
putting
their
heads
down
and
“come
up
again
dear”
made
up
my
mind
about
it
if
i’m
mabel
i’ll
stay
down
here
it’ll
be
no
toys
to
play
with
and
oh
so
many
lessons
to
learn
no
i
shall
have
to
go
and
live
in
that
little
house
and
have
next
filled
with
tears
again
as
she
went
on
‘i
must
be
mabel
all
‘i’m
sure
those
are
not
the
right
words’
said
poor
alice
and
her
with
and
welcome
little
fishes
how
spread
his
‘how
he
seems
to
on
every
golden
and
pour
the
waters
of
the
improve
his
‘how
doth
the
little
same
as
they
to
but
her
voice
sounded
hoarse
and
strange
and
the
words
did
not
come
hands
on
her
lap
as
if
she
were
lessons
and
began
to
repeat
mabel
i’ll
try
and
say
“how
doth
the
little“’
and
she
romeno
that’s
all
wrong
i’m
certain
i
must
have
been
changed
london
is
the
capital
of
paris
and
paris
is
the
capital
of
rome
however
the
multiplication
table
doesn’t
signify
let’s
try
four
seven
isoh
dear
i
shall
never
get
to
twenty
at
that
see
four
five
is
twelve
and
four
six
is
thirteen
it
all
is
i’ll
try
if
i
know
all
the
things
i
to
know
let
very
little
she’s
she
and
i’m
i
andoh
dear
how
be
mabel
for
i
know
all
sorts
of
things
and
she
oh
she
knows
such
ringlets
and
mine
doesn’t
go
in
ringlets
at
all
and
i’m
sure
i
‘i’m
sure
i’m
not
ada’
she
said
‘for
her
hair
goes
in
such
see
if
she
could
have
been
changed
for
any
of
over
all
the
children
she
knew
that
were
of
the
same
age
as
herself
in
the
world
am
i
ah
that’s
the
great
puzzle’
and
she
began
little
different
but
if
i’m
not
the
same
the
next
question
is
same
when
i
got
up
this
i
almost
think
i
can
remember
i
wonder
if
i’ve
been
changed
in
the
night
let
me
think
was
i
queer
everything
is
today
and
yesterday
things
went
on
just
as
kept
herself
all
the
time
she
went
on
‘dear
dear
alice
took
up
the
fan
and
gloves
and
as
the
hall
was
very
hot
and
skurried
away
into
the
as
hard
as
he
could
the
rabbit
started
dropped
the
white
kid
gloves
and
the
came
near
her
she
began
in
a
low
timid
voice
‘if
you
please
desperate
that
she
was
ready
to
ask
help
of
any
one
so
when
the
oh
won’t
she
be
savage
if
i’ve
kept
her
waiting’
alice
felt
hurry
to
himself
as
he
came
‘oh
the
duchess
the
one
hand
and
a
large
fan
in
the
other
he
came
trotting
along
in
a
rabbit
returning
with
a
pair
of
white
kid
gloves
she
dried
her
eyes
to
see
what
was
it
was
the
a
time
she
heard
a
little
pattering
of
feet
in
the
deep
and
half
down
the
tears
until
there
was
a
large
pool
all
round
her
about
four
moment
i
tell
you’
but
she
went
on
all
the
same
gallons
you’
she
might
well
say
this
‘to
go
on
in
this
way
stop
‘you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself’
said
alice
‘a
great
girl
than
she
sat
down
and
began
to
cry
look
through
into
the
garden
with
one
eye
but
to
get
through
was
poor
alice
it
was
as
much
as
she
could
do
lying
down
on
one
side
key
and
off
to
the
garden
now
more
than
nine
feet
high
and
she
at
once
took
up
the
little
just
then
her
head
struck
against
the
roof
of
the
hall
in
fact
she
oh
dear
what
i’m
with
alice’s
near
the
alice’s
right
foot
presents
to
one’s
own
feet
and
how
odd
the
directions
will
go
the
carrier’
she
thought
‘and
how
funny
it’ll
seem
and
she
went
on
planning
to
herself
how
she
would
manage
it
‘they
to
go
let
me
see
i’ll
give
them
a
new
pair
of
every
kind
to
them’
thought
alice
‘or
perhaps
they
won’t
walk
the
way
i
myself
about
you
you
must
manage
the
best
way
you
canbut
i
must
i
shan’t
be
able
i
shall
be
a
great
deal
too
far
off
to
who
will
put
on
your
shoes
and
stockings
for
you
now
dears
i’m
sight
they
were
so
far
off
‘oh
my
poor
little
feet
i
for
when
she
looked
down
at
her
feet
they
seemed
to
be
almost
out
out
like
the
largest
telescope
that
was
goodbye
for
the
moment
she
quite
forgot
how
to
speak
good
english
‘now
‘curiouser
and
curiouser’
cried
alice
she
was
so
much
surprised
chapter
ii
the
pool
of
so
she
set
to
work
and
very
soon
off
the
in
the
common
things
to
happen
that
it
seemed
quite
dull
and
stupid
for
life
to
go
had
got
so
much
into
the
way
of
expecting
nothing
but
size
to
be
sure
this
happens
when
one
cake
but
and
she
was
quite
surprised
to
find
that
she
remained
the
way’
her
hand
on
the
top
of
her
head
to
feel
which
way
it
she
ate
a
little
bit
and
said
to
herself
‘which
way
get
into
the
garden
and
i
don’t
care
which
makes
me
grow
smaller
i
can
creep
under
the
door
so
either
way
alice
‘and
if
it
makes
me
grow
larger
i
can
reach
the
key
and
if
‘eat
me’
were
in
currants
‘well
i’ll
eat
it’
she
opened
it
and
found
in
it
a
very
small
cake
on
which
the
soon
her
eye
fell
on
a
little
glass
box
that
was
lying
under
the
why
there’s
enough
of
me
left
to
make
one
‘but
it’s
no
use
now’
thought
poor
alice
‘to
pretend
to
be
two
for
this
curious
child
was
very
fond
of
pretending
to
be
two
cheated
herself
in
a
game
of
croquet
she
was
playing
against
her
eyes
and
once
she
remembered
to
box
her
own
ears
for
and
she
scolded
herself
so
as
to
bring
tears
gave
herself
very
good
advice
though
she
very
seldom
followed
rather
‘i
advise
you
to
leave
off
this
minute’
she
‘come
there’s
no
use
in
like
that’
said
alice
to
sat
down
and
and
when
she
had
herself
out
with
the
poor
little
best
to
climb
up
one
of
the
legs
of
the
table
but
it
was
too
it
she
could
see
it
quite
through
the
glass
and
she
tried
went
back
to
the
table
for
it
she
found
she
could
not
door
she
found
she
had
forgotten
the
little
golden
key
and
when
into
the
garden
at
once
but
for
poor
alice
when
she
got
to
a
while
that
nothing
more
happened
she
on
having
seen
such
a
candle
is
like
the
candle
is
blown
out
for
she
could
not
what
i
should
be
like
then’
and
she
tried
to
fancy
what
the
flame
of
alice
to
herself
‘in
my
out
altogether
like
a
candle
i
she
felt
a
little
nervous
about
this
‘for
it
might
end
you
know’
waited
for
a
few
minutes
to
see
if
she
was
to
shrink
any
through
the
little
door
into
that
garden
first
however
brightened
up
at
the
thought
that
she
was
now
the
right
size
for
and
so
it
was
indeed
she
was
now
only
ten
inches
high
and
her
‘what
a
curious
feeling’
said
alice
‘i
must
be
up
like
toast
she
very
soon
it
of
cherrytart
pineapple
roast
turkey
toffee
and
it
and
it
very
nice
it
had
in
fact
a
sort
of
however
this
bottle
was
not
‘poison’
so
alice
ventured
to
almost
certain
to
with
you
or
forgotten
that
if
you
drink
much
from
a
bottle
‘poison’
it
finger
very
with
a
knife
it
bleeds
and
she
had
will
burn
you
if
you
hold
it
too
long
and
that
if
you
cut
the
simple
rules
their
friends
had
taught
them
such
as
that
a
beasts
and
other
things
all
because
they
would
not
little
histories
about
children
who
had
got
burnt
and
eaten
up
see
whether
it’s
“poison”
or
not’
for
she
had
read
several
not
to
do
that
in
a
hurry
‘no
i’ll
look
first’
she
said
it
was
all
very
well
to
say
‘drink
me’
but
the
wise
little
alice
label
with
the
words
‘drink
me’
on
it
in
before’
said
alice
and
round
the
neck
of
the
bottle
was
a
time
she
found
a
little
bottle
on
it
‘which
was
not
any
rate
a
book
of
rules
for
people
up
like
telescopes
back
to
the
table
half
hoping
she
might
find
another
key
on
it
or
there
seemed
to
be
no
use
in
the
little
door
so
she
that
alice
had
begun
to
think
that
very
few
things
indeed
were
for
you
see
so
many
outoftheway
things
had
happened
shut
up
like
a
telescope
i
think
i
could
if
i
only
knew
how
to
would
be
of
very
little
use
without
my
shoulders
oh
how
i
wish
i
doorway
‘and
even
if
my
head
would
go
through’
thought
poor
alice
those
cool
fountains
but
she
could
not
even
get
her
head
through
that
dark
hall
and
wander
about
among
those
beds
of
bright
flowers
into
the
loveliest
garden
you
saw
how
she
longed
to
get
out
much
larger
than
a
she
knelt
down
and
looked
along
the
alice
opened
the
door
and
found
that
it
led
into
a
small
passage
little
golden
key
in
the
lock
and
to
her
great
delight
it
behind
it
was
a
little
door
about
fifteen
inches
high
she
tried
time
round
she
came
upon
a
low
curtain
she
had
not
noticed
before
but
at
any
rate
it
would
not
open
any
of
them
however
on
the
but
either
the
locks
were
too
large
or
the
key
was
too
first
thought
was
that
it
might
belong
to
one
of
the
doors
of
the
glass
there
was
nothing
on
it
except
a
tiny
golden
key
and
she
came
upon
a
little
threelegged
table
all
made
of
get
out
door
she
walked
down
the
middle
how
she
was
alice
had
been
all
the
way
down
one
side
and
up
the
other
there
were
doors
all
round
the
hall
but
they
were
all
and
from
the
herself
in
a
long
low
hall
which
was
lit
up
a
row
of
lamps
the
but
the
rabbit
was
no
to
be
seen
she
and
whiskers
how
late
it’s
getting’
she
was
close
behind
it
when
was
just
in
time
to
hear
it
say
as
it
a
‘oh
my
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
away
went
alice
like
the
wind
long
passage
and
the
white
rabbit
was
still
in
sight
hurrying
down
she
looked
up
but
it
was
all
dark
before
her
was
alice
was
not
a
bit
hurt
and
she
jumped
up
on
to
her
feet
in
a
a
heap
of
and
dry
and
the
fall
was
did
you
eat
a
bat’
when
thump
thump
down
she
came
dinah
and
to
her
very
‘now
dinah
tell
me
the
off
and
had
just
begun
to
dream
that
she
was
hand
in
hand
it
didn’t
much
which
way
she
put
it
she
felt
that
she
was
eat
cats’
for
you
see
as
she
couldn’t
answer
either
sort
of
way
‘do
cats
eat
do
cats
eat
bats’
and
began
to
get
rather
sleepy
and
went
on
to
herself
in
a
like
a
mouse
you
know
but
do
cats
eat
i
wonder’
and
here
mice
in
the
air
i’m
afraid
but
you
might
catch
a
bat
and
that’s
dinah
my
dear
i
wish
you
were
down
here
with
me
there
are
dinah
was
the
cat
‘i
hope
they’ll
remember
her
of
milk
again
‘dinah’ll
miss
me
very
much
tonight
i
should
down
down
down
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
so
alice
soon
ask
perhaps
i
shall
see
it
written
up
ignorant
little
girl
she’ll
think
me
for
asking
no
it’ll
never
do
through
the
air
do
you
think
you
could
manage
it
‘and
what
she
tried
to
curtsey
as
she
spokefancy
curtseying
as
you’re
is
you
know
please
ma’am
is
this
new
zealand
or
australia’
right
word
‘but
i
shall
have
to
ask
them
what
the
name
of
the
there
was
no
one
this
time
as
it
didn’t
sound
at
all
their
heads
downward
the
antipathies
i
think’
she
was
rather
earth
how
funny
it’ll
seem
to
come
out
among
the
people
that
walk
she
began
again
‘i
wonder
if
i
shall
fall
right
through
longitude
either
but
thought
they
were
nice
grand
words
to
or
longitude
i’ve
got
to’
alice
had
no
idea
what
latitude
was
‘yes
that’s
about
the
right
distancebut
then
i
wonder
what
was
no
one
to
listen
to
her
still
it
was
good
practice
to
say
it
was
not
a
very
good
for
off
her
knowledge
as
things
of
this
sort
in
her
lessons
in
the
schoolroom
and
though
thousand
miles
down
i
think’
for
you
see
alice
had
somewhere
near
the
centre
of
the
earth
let
me
see
that
would
be
many
miles
i’ve
fallen
this
time’
she
said
aloud
‘i
must
be
down
down
down
would
the
fall
never
come
to
an
end
‘i
wonder
of
the
house’
which
was
very
home
why
i
wouldn’t
say
anything
about
it
even
if
i
fell
off
the
think
nothing
of
down
stairs
how
brave
they’ll
all
think
me
‘well’
thought
alice
to
herself
‘after
such
a
fall
as
this
i
she
fell
past
of
somebody
so
managed
to
put
it
into
one
of
the
cupboards
it
was
empty
she
did
not
like
to
drop
the
jar
for
she
passed
it
was
labelled
‘orange
marmalade’
but
to
her
hung
upon
pegs
she
took
down
a
jar
from
one
of
the
shelves
cupboards
and
bookshelves
here
and
there
she
saw
maps
and
looked
at
the
of
the
well
and
noticed
that
they
were
filled
she
was
to
but
it
was
too
dark
to
see
anything
then
to
happen
next
first
she
tried
to
look
down
and
make
out
plenty
of
time
as
she
went
down
to
look
about
her
and
to
wonder
what
either
the
well
was
very
deep
or
she
fell
very
for
she
about
herself
before
she
found
herself
down
a
very
down
so
that
alice
had
not
a
moment
to
the
rabbithole
went
straight
on
like
a
tunnel
for
some
way
and
in
the
world
she
was
to
get
out
in
another
moment
down
went
alice
it
never
once
rabbithole
under
the
it
and
was
just
in
time
to
see
it
pop
down
a
to
take
out
of
it
and
with
curiosity
she
ran
across
the
never
before
seen
a
rabbit
with
either
a
waistcoatpocket
or
a
alice
started
to
her
feet
for
it
flashed
across
her
mind
that
she
out
of
waistcoatpocket
and
looked
at
it
and
then
it
all
seemed
quite
natural
but
when
the
rabbit
took
a
occurred
to
her
that
she
ought
to
have
wondered
at
this
but
at
the
oh
dear
i
shall
be
late’
when
she
thought
it
over
very
much
out
of
the
way
to
hear
the
rabbit
say
to
itself
‘oh
there
was
nothing
so
very
in
that
nor
did
alice
think
it
close
picking
the
daisies
when
a
white
rabbit
with
pink
eyes
of
a
daisychain
would
be
worth
the
trouble
of
up
hot
day
made
her
feel
very
sleepy
and
stupid
whether
the
so
she
was
in
her
own
mind
as
well
as
she
could
for
it
‘and
what
is
the
use
of
a
book’
thought
alice
‘without
pictures

her
sister
was
but
it
had
no
pictures
or
conversations

and
